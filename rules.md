# Rules

## Keeping Track of Time

A Turn is a time measurement used to determine how often certain abilities or actions can be taken. Some powers can be triggered only so many times per scene, while some special abilities only work once per scene.

A Turn is one particular fight, event, activity, or effort that usually doesn’t take more than ten or fifteen minutes. A fight is a scene. A chase is a scene. A tense backroom negotiation is a scene. So long as the PCs are doing the same general activity in the same general location, it’s probably one scene. Most scenes don’t last more than fifteen minutes, though a GM can stretch this if it seems logical.

Combat is made up of Rounds, each one lasting approximately ten seconds. A single combat may involve multiple Rounds of action, but always takes a turn. A round begins with the actions of the side that wins initiative and ends after the actions of the side that lost initiative.

Between adventures or in safe places, time passes naturally, usually counted in either hours, days, or weeks as appropriate.

## Saving Throws

Saving throws are rolled to resist some unusual danger or chance hazard. To make a saving throw, a person rolls 1d20 and tries to get equal or higher than their saving throw target. Sometimes a save might have bonuses or penalties applied to the roll, but a natural roll of 1 on the die always fails the save, and a natural roll of 20 is always a success.

There are four types of saving throws. Usually it will be obvious which type is most appropriate for a threat, but the GM can decide in marginal situations.

**Physical** saves resist exhaustion, poisons, diseases, or other bodily afflictions. A PC’s Physical saving throw target is equal to 16 minus their character level and the highest of their Strength or Constitution modifiers.

**Evasion** saves apply when dodging explosions, avoiding traps, reacting to sudden peril, or other occasions where speed is of the essence. A PC’s Evasion saving throw target is equal to 16 minus their character level and the highest of their Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers.

**Mental** saves apply when resisting mental attacks, insubstantial magic spells, psychological trauma, and other mental hazards. A PC’s Mental saving throw target is equal to 16 minus their character level and the highest of their Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.

**Luck** saves are used when only blind chance can save a PC, regardless of their native abilities. A PC’s Luck saving throw target is equal to 16 minus their character level, unmodified by their attributes.

NPCs have a single saving throw target equal to 15 minus half their rounded-down hit dice. Thus, an NPC with 3 HD would have a saving throw target of 14+ for any particular hazard.

## Skill Checks

Most characters are skilled, competent folks who are perfectly capable of carrying out the ordinary duties of their role. Sometimes, however, they are faced with a situation or challenge beyond the usual scope of their role and the GM calls for a skill check.

To make a skill check, roll 2d6 and add the most relevant skill level and attribute modifier. If the total is equal or higher than the check’s difficulty, the check is a success. On a failure, the PC either can’t accomplish the feat at all, bad luck cheats them, or they achieve it at the cost of some further complication. The GM determines the specific consequence of a failure.

If the character is untrained in the pertinent skill, they suffer a -1 penalty to the roll. In the case of particularly technical or esoteric skills they might not even be able to attempt the skill check at all.

The GM is always the one who calls for a skill check, and they do so at their discretion. The player simply describes what their PC is attempting to do, and the GM will tell them what skill and attribute combination to roll. If multiple skills or attributes might plausibly fit the action, the player can pick the one most favorable to them. If the combination is only marginally relevant, but still reasonably plausible, it might suffer a -1 or -2 penalty at the GM’s discretion.

| Difficulty | Skill Check                                                                                                                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 6          | A relatively simple task that is still more than the PC would usually be expected to manage in their regular background. Anything easier than this isn’t worth a skill check. |
| 8          | A significant challenge to a competent professional that they’d still succeed at more often than not.                                                                                |
| 10         | Something too difficult to be expected of anyone but a skilled expert, and even they might fail.                                                                                      |
| 12         | Only a true master could expect to carry this off with any degree of reliability.                                                                                                     |
| 14+        | Only a true master has any chance of achieving this at all, and even they will probably fail.                                                                                         |

### NPC Skill Checks

When an NPC needs to make a skill check, they roll 2d6 and add their listed skill modifier if their action is something they ought reason- ably to be good at. If it isn’t, they roll at +0, or even at -1 if it seems like something they’d be particularly bad at doing. If the NPC is special enough to have actual attribute scores and skill levels, they use those instead.

### Aiding a Skill Check

To aid a comrade’s skill check, a player explains what their PC is doing to help. If the GM agrees that it’s plausible, they may roll a relevant skill and attribute modifier against the same difficulty as the check they are aiding. If they succeed, their ally gains a +1 on their skill check. If they fail, no harm is done. Multiple PCs can try to aid if their actions are plausible, but the total bonus can’t exceed +1.

Aiding a comrade is usually done in ways that let the aiding PC leverage their own special talents or skills. A PC may not have the skills to attempt to Sneak past a vigilant guard, for example, but they might have a good Perform skill they can use to create a distraction that helps their comrade skulk past.

### Opposed Skill Checks

When skills oppose each other, each participant makes a skill check and the winner is the one who rolls higher. In cases of ties, the PC wins. Thus, a PC trying to sneak past a guard might roll 2d6 plus their Dex/Sneak against the guard’s 2d6 plus their skill modifier. If the guard was significant enough to actually have attributes and skill levels, it might be a Dex/Sneak challenge versus their Wis/Notice.

## Injury, Healing, and System Strain

Injury is almost inevitable in an adventurer’s career. Some forms of it can be longer-lasting than others.

### Mortal Injury and Stabalization

When a PC is reduced to zero hit points by a lethal attack, they are Mortally Injured. They will die at the end of the sixth round after their incapacitation unless stabilized by an ally or some special ability. A Mortally Wounded character is helpless, and can take no actions and do nothing useful.

Stabilizing an ally is usually a Main Action that requires a Dex/ Heal or Int/Heal skill check. The difficulty is 8 plus the number of full rounds since the target fell. If the medic lacks a healer’s kit or other tools, this difficulty is increased by 2. Only one ally can try to stabilize a victim per round, though others can attempt to aid their check, but attempts may be retried each round for as long as hope lasts.

Once stabilized the victim remains incapacitated for ten minutes before recovering with 1 hit point and the Frail condition. They may act normally after they recover, but if they are reduced to zero hit points again while still Frail, they die instantly. Frailty is removed by a week of bed rest and medical care. A physician can also make one attempt to remove Frailty with a healer’s kit and an hour of work, rolling a Dex/Heal or Int/Heal skill check against difficulty 10.

### NPCs and Mortal Injury

NPCs who aren’t important enough to merit a name usually die in- stantly when reduced to zero hit points.

### System Strain

Magical forms of healing or use of powerful augmenting magic can take a toll on a user’s physiology. Their System Strain total reflects the total amount of stress their body has undergone.

A healthy character normally starts at zero System Strain and has their Constitution score as their allowed maximum. A character cannot accumulate more than this maximum in System Strain.

Magical healing and certain spells and abilities will add to a subject’s System Strain. If this addition would put them over their maximum they cannot activate the spell, benefit from healing, or otherwise gain any use from the ability. If they are forced over the maximum by some unavoidable effect, they are instead knocked unconscious for at least an hour.

Characters lose one point of accumulated System Strain after each night’s rest, assuming they are warm, fed, and comfortable and can get at least eight uninterrupted hours of sleep. Cold camps, stony bedding, and other sources of privation prevent this recuperation.

### Natural Healing

A wounded creature can recover hit points by getting a good night’s rest and adequate food. Provided they are warm, fed, and comfort- able, they regain hit points each morning equal to their experience level, or equal to their hit dice if they are NPCs. Characters suffering some form of privation do not recover hit points through sleep.

Frail creatures do not recover hit points through natural healing. They must cure their Frail condition first or rely on pharmaceuticals. Removing the Frail condition requires a full week of bed rest and the medical attention of someone with at least Heal-0 skill and a healer’s kit. Frail victims without this level of medical care must make a Physical save after a week; on a failure they die sometime in the next week, while success means they lose their Frailty after another month’s rest.

### First Aid

Healers can patch up victims in a hurry, albeit at a cost to their phys- ical resilience. By spending one minute patching up an ally with a healer’s kit, a healer can heal 1d6 points of damage plus their Heal skill. If they lack any Heal skill at all, they restore 1d6-1 points. Each such application of first aid adds one System Strain to the target. First aid can restore hit points to a Frail target, but it cannot remove their Frailty.

One ten-minute turn is enough time for a healer to apply as much first aid as is wanted to the rest of their party.

### Poisons and Diseases

Most toxins force a victim to make a Physical saving throw to resist their effects or mitigate their harm. Weak perils might grant as much as a +4 to the saving throw, while dire threats might apply a -4 penalty.

If the save is failed, the poison or disease takes hold. Most poisons act quickly, inflicting hit point damage, adding System Strain to the target, or applying long-lasting penalties. Diseases can have a slower onset but often apply the same sort of harms.

A medic who gets to a poisoned person within a minute of the poisoning can use a healer’s kit to give them a better chance to resist. They may add twice their Heal skill level to the victim’s saving throw roll, or +1 if they have only Heal-0 skill. Specialized antitoxins may be able to neutralize such poisons entirely.

## Chases and Pursuit

Adventurers have a habit of chasing after others and being chased in turn.

If one group is faster than the other group, that group succeeds.

The group member in the fleeing party with the best Dex/Exert or Con/Exert total rolls a skill check. Their result is the fleeing group’s pace, as they help and encourage the slower members.

Other fleeing group members then hinder pursuit in whatever ways they think are helpful. Sometimes a skill check is needed, while other times a GM will simply decide it works. Each successful effort adds a +1 bonus to the pace, up to +3 maximum. Botched efforts are either unhelpful or apply a -1 penalty if they’re actively harmful. If the fleeing group is made up of NPCs, it’s the GM’s judgment as to whether any of them try to do something clever to stall the PCs.

The pursuing group then makes a single Dex/Exert or Con/Ex- ert skill check, modified by the table below. If they beat the fleeing group’s total they catch up to them, and if they tie or roll less the fleeing party has escaped immediate pursuit.


| Situation                                        | Mod |
| ------------------------------------------------ | --- |
| There are more pursuers than pursued             | -1  |
| The pursued have no head start at all            | +2  |
| The pursued have one round's head start          | +1  |
| The pursued have less than a minute's head start | +0  |
| The pursued have more than a minute's head start | -2  |
| The pursuit is half-hearted or obligatory        | -1  |
| The pursuers are enraged or vengeful             | +1  |

## Encumbrance

Gear has encumbrance, measured in points, as exampled in the table below. The more awkward or bulky the object, the greater the encumbrance. The GM adjudicates ambiguous objects.

| Gear                                    | Encumbrance |
| --------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| Portable in a small pocket              | 0           |
| Portable in one hand                    | 1           |
| Requires two hands to carry or use it   | 2           |
| Requires a whole-body effort to haul it | 5+          |
| Dragging an unconscious teammate        | 12          |

Gear is either Stowed or Readied. Stowed gear is packed away carefully in pockets, packs, and harnesses. It’s easier to carry but harder to quickly access. Using Stowed gear requires that the bear- er take a Main Action to pull it out before using it. Readied gear is carried in hands, holsters, quick-access pockets, or other easily-ac- cessible places. It can be used as part of an action without any further preparation.

A character can carry a total number of Stowed encumbrance points equal to their Strength score. They can carry a number of Readied points equal to half their Strength, rounded down. Thus, a PC with a Strength score of 11 could carry 11 points of Stowed gear and 5 points of Readied.

PCs can haul much heavier objects if necessary. If they push their limits for longer terms, they can carry an additional two Ready and four Stowed items. The first time they do this, their Move speed is cut by 30%, from 30 feet to 20 feet. The second time, it’s cut by 50%, from 20 feet to 10 feet. More weight than this can’t be practically hauled over significant distances.

### Bundled Gear

Small, regularly-shaped objects such as oil flasks, potion bottles, rations, and torches can be wrapped into bundles for easier porta- bility. Three such items can be tied into a bundle that only counts as one item of encumbrance. Breaking into this bundle takes an extra Main Action, however.

### Bulk Weights

Sometimes the PCs need to transport bulk amounts of goods that are measured in pounds. When it’s necessary to convert these weights into encumbrance points, a GM can just assume that fifty pounds is worth about ten points of encumbrance to a PC hauling a pack out on their back.

When judging the ability of a vehicle to carry encumbrance points of cargo, it can be assumed that a wagon can carry as much as the PCs need it to carry, within reason.

### Pack Animals and Porters

To haul more equipment and loot than the PCs can carry, they need pack animals or porters.

| Type                                       | Enc |
| ------------------------------------------ | --- |
| Heavy pack horse                           | 30  |
| Mule or donkey                             | 15  |
| Professional porter                        | 12  |
| Two porters carrying a shared litter       | 30  |

## Falling and Other Hazards
Some perils occur with some regularity for adventurers. A few of the most common are detailed here.

Falling: Most creatures will take 1d6 damage per 10 full feet they fall, up to 20d6 maximum. Spikes or other hazardous terrain at the bottom will add at least 1d6 to the total. A creature that intentionally leaps or skids down in a controlled way may make a Dex or Str/Exert skill check at a difficulty of 7 + 1 for every 10 full feet; on a success, the effective distance fallen is halved.

Suffocation: Creatures can fight or act normally without air for one round per point of Constitution, or 10 rounds for most NPCs. If they don’t move, they can quadruple this time. Once they run out of air, they must make a Physical save each round or take 1 hit point of damage per HD or level they have.

Poisons: Typical dungeon poisons found crusted on needle traps force a Physical save or a loss of half the victim’s maximum hit points. Very potent ones might kill a victim outright. Those who die due to poison damage usually take at least 1d4 turns to actually expire, but are helpless in the meanwhile. An antidote applied during this time can revive them with 1 hit point. A skilled healer can try to counteract the toxin with an Int/Heal skill check at a difficult of at least 10 for most poisons, or 12 or more for truly fearsome ones.

Aside from any hit point damage a poison does, many also have lingering side effects, such as penalties to hit rolls or skill checks, or the loss of Move actions for a certain period of time. Some also add System Strain to the victim due to the stress they put on their bodies. A victim forced above their maximum System Strain will collapse and die in minutes if the poison is not neutralized.

## Overland Travel

Unless there is an *extremely* compelling reason to play it out, skip to arriving at the destination. For time-tracking purposes, Delvers are able to travel ~18 miles/day.

## Dungeon Exploration

These rules are meant for tracking adventures in a dangerous site where perils could spring up at any moment. They’re not meant for casual exploration of some bosky glade or city street, and in such cases the PC actions can just be followed scene-by-scene as usual. It’s important that GMs understand the purpose of the Wandering Encounter checks in a site. They’re intended to put constant pressure on the party to get in, accomplish their purpose, and get out before they’re worn down by encounters. Not all Wandering Encounters are hostile, but each is a risk of pointless fighting or sudden alarm.

### Dungeon Exploration Procedure

At the start of each turn after the party enters the site:

1. Roll a secret Wandering Encounter check if necessary. On a 1, the encounter will happen at some appropriate moment this turn.
2. The PCs decide what they want to do this turn, be it move into a new room, carefully search their current location, fiddle with some object they’ve found, or something else that takes ten minutes.
3. Tell them the result of their actions, whether that’s a first- glance description of a new room, notice of the hideous abomination that’s rearing up before them, or the explosive detonation of the crystal they just experimentally rapped.
4. Start over from the top, assuming their actions have con- sumed a full turn, until they withdraw from the site or it becomes safe enough to stop counting turns.

### Timekeeping in the Dungeon

Once the heroes intrude on a ruin, dungeon, corrupt noble’s mansion, or other dangerous site the GM starts tracking time in turns. Each turn counts as about ten minutes or one scene. Members of the party can generally do one significant thing per turn. Different party members can be doing different things in the same turn.

The point of tracking turns isn’t to have a minute-by-minute tally of PC activities, but to have a rough measure of how much activity they’re engaging in within the ruin. The more they do and the longer they stay, the more likely that they’ll run into Wandering Encounters or the natives will have time to realize that intruders are present. Eventually, the PCs need to either pull back or clear the site entirely of its dangerous inhabitants.

#### Example Time Costs in Turns

| Activity                                       | Turns |
|------------------------------------------------|-------|
| Move from one room of interest to another      | 1     |
| Pick a lock or disarm a trap                   | 1     |
| Get in a fight with something                  | 1     |
| Perform first aid and looting after a fight    | 1     |
| Search a room carefully                        | 1     |
| Time a torch lasts until burning out           | 6     |
| Time a filled lantern lasts before burning out | 24    |

### Encounters and Surprise
Usually, PCs are sufficiently alert when exploring a site to avoid any chance of surprise, barring a set ambush. If they burst in on the natives suddenly, however, the locals might be too stunned to act for a round.

If the GM thinks this is possible, give it X-out-of-6 odds. If the PCs run into a Wandering Encounter in a room, the creatures will enter through one of the available entrances. In the corridors outside, they’re usually 1d8 x 10 feet away when first spotted or heard, assuming there’s enough space for such a distance.

Remember to make a reaction roll when PCs encounter creatures. Not every group of dungeon denizens will immediately lunge for their weapons.

Usually, there’s a brief, tense moment of recognition when the PCs encounter creatures, just enough time for a reaction roll and a chance to size up the odds of diplomacy. The GM should always give the PCs a chance to parley or run when encountering creatures unless the situation makes that completely impractical.

### Wandering Encounter Checks in the Dungeon

Every so many turns, a GM should roll 1d6 to check for a Wandering Encounter. On a 1, the PCs will run into one at some point during the turn. The frequency of the check will depend on how vigorously alert and organized the site’s inhabitants are.

The actual contents of the encounter are decided when the GM puts together the site. Not all encounters involve running into creatures. Some are mere events or situations that fit the site. In the same vein, not all encounters are necessarily hostile, either. Reaction rolls should be made for all groups of creatures.

#### When to Roll an Encounter Check

| Type of Location                           | Turns    |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| Alerted site with organized defenders      | Every 1  |
| Unalert site with organized defenders      | Every 2  |
| Site with no organized or active defense   | Every 3  |
| Site with very few mobile inhabitants      | Every 4  |
| Abandoned or disused nook in a site        | Every 6  |
| Chamber unknown to the natives of the site | No check |
