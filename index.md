Welcome to Sovereign!

This game endeavors to provide a ruleset that allows players to play through adventures compatible with [1980s D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set). Little conversion should be necessary. The game hopes to be written more clearly, be more searchable, better hyperlinked, have more depth, and boast a better in-game economy.

This document is split in several sections.

[Examples of Play](/examples) tries to cover the major systems and subsystems, as well as convey some play culture.

An extensive [game master section](/running-the-game) is in progress! In the mean time, much of the material can be found in long-form in my review of [Brandonsford](https://rancourt.substack.com/p/review-the-black-wyrm-of-brandonsford), ruminations on [randomness](https://rancourt.substack.com/p/on-randomness), my audit of [silveraxe](https://rancourt.substack.com/p/audit-tower-silveraxe), [Beginning Game Masters - The Alexandrian](https://thealexandrian.net/gamemastery-101), the [Art of Rulings](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/4238/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-rulings), the [Art of Pacing](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/31509/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-pacing) and the [Art of the Key](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/35180/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-the-key).

### Under Construction

- Actually playtest the classes. I know it uses WWN which has its own playtesting, but there's probably still jank somewhere.
- Make sure that there's enough skills for all the advancement points that PCs get while leveling up. Need to make sure that not every high level character is the same.
- Make sure that there's enough feats for spellcasters.
- The whole GM section. The advice and theory can wait, but conversion guides and whatnot are pressing.

### Change Log

#### 2024-08-19
- Fix table scrolling
- Update number of suggested magic items per adventure.

#### 2024-08-18

- Add an example of reaction rolls.

#### 2024-08-14

- Specify that System Strain and spell slots can only be recovered in settlements.

#### 2024-08-13
- Clean up the time keeping + wandering encounter text
- Hide alignment philosophy links in the text. They were too technical to be explicitly called out.

#### 2024-08-08
- Hyperlink System Strain.
- Change disengage to work on all foes. All of the core *WN books work this way, it's just the SRDs that are different.
- Simplify language around skill levels.
- Specify that moving triggers a free attack when you leave a foe's threatened range.

- Add a section on alignment.

- Hyperlink the saving throws.
- Implement search! Whew.

#### 2024-08-02
- De-jargon a bit. "Module" is an esoteric term, "adventure" is not.

#### 2024-08-01
- Get the nav bar for the toc to be responsive.

#### 2024-07-31
- Add rules for scrolls, potions, and sentient weapons.
- Add the list of adventures, sourced from [tenfootpole](https://tenfootpole.org/ironspike) and [beyondformalhaut](https://beyondfomalhaut.blogspot.com/).
- Add an explanation of the grid for combat.
- Change hit roll to attack roll.
- Oops. Accursed get arts as they level now.
- Magic weapons add their bonus to Shock.
- Standardize text around actions.
- Somehow the metric system slipped it. It has been removed.
- Use HD for npcs
- Use HP Progression for Delvers
- hyperlink all of the skills.
- Get an actual table of contents going. Thanks Lina!

#### 2024-07-30
- Give the spell level headers unique names so the hyperlinks work.
- Rename "arts and spells" to "progression" to be more clear.
- Hyperlink and standardize Bonus Skills.
- Clarify Screen an Ally
- Use HD for npcs
- Use HP Progression for Delvers

#### 2024-07-28
- Build a table of contents for the index and each section.
- Reorganize the spell hierarchy
- Use (C) instead of the crossed swords emoji for feats. Works better for hyperlinks.
- Clean up the index page now that we have a ToC.
- Link to OSE instead of BF for magic items; it's a little better.
- Tabulate the combat actions.
- Explain how to make improvised combat actions.
- Specify that snap attacks can make spells and other attacks fizzle
- Remove last vestiges of Instinct.
- Cleanup and hyperlink the [rules](/rules).
- Hyperlink the [classes](/classes).
- Explain which game mechanic each attribute touches.
- Hyperlink equipment and add color to the adventuring gear.

#### 2024-07-26
- Add check penalties to chain and plate armor.
- Include attributes in group checks.
- Add a tutorial for skill checks.

#### 2024-07-25
- Add big picture and core loop tutorials.
- Add the under construction section.
- Add a worked example for the core loop tutorial.

#### 2024-07-25
- Remove Lead and Lead-based Feats. Use leverage instead.
- Remove Charisma
- Worked delver creation example. Whew.

#### 2024-07-24
- Add a tutorial for learning delver creation. Still need a worked example.
- Keep items on card stock
- Add rules for doors. So many doors.
- Drop a ton of instances of 'may' and 'can' that weren't actual choices.
- Use "HP" instead of "hit points".
- Add paragraphs to the spell descriptions.
- Use those outside the walls and basic fantasy as stop-gaps.
- Add a narrative interaction section.
- Add morale.
- Add a core game loop section.
- Standardize on 'attack bonus' - it was sometimes called 'base attack bonus'.

#### 2024-07-23
- Use population sizes instead of ACKS's market classes for equipment availability.
- Use "feat" instead of "focus".
- Use "Free Action" instead of "On Turn Action" to free up the "Turn" word.
- Use "Turn" instead of "Scene", consolidating those keywords.
- Simplify the spell names to be more D&D-familiar. The WWN names are [antimemetic](https://qntm.org/scp).
- Use the ACKs prices for equipment instead of the WWN prices
- Remove the luck saving throw; we just don't need it.
- Remove WWN backgrounds, simplify to just making 4 total improvements.
- Remove Administer, Connect, Convince, Craft, Perform, Sail, Survive, Trade, and Work as skills. They're inappropriate for this style of play.
- Remove the feats associated with those skills.
- Remove the Bard, Beastmaster, Blood priest, Invoker, Mage Slayer, Skinshifter, Thought noble, Vowed, and Wise classes. The class list was bloated and each niche we carve out makes each other class less flexible. This also makes it so that there are no warrior or expert sub-classes, which simplifies the language.
- Simplify the skill levels. There was an implied -1 level before (untrained) that gave an extra -1 for specifically attack rolls. Remove that exception and start all skills at level -1.
- Standardize language around attribute modifiers. Rather than saying "Strength modifier", we just say "STR".
- Remove starting packages. Just buy gear!
- Standardize group checks and aiding skill checks into the same thing.
- Rewrite opposed checks so that only one side is rolling. This saves time at the table and is probabilistically equivalent.
- Remove *tons* of weasel words.
- Resolve "optional" rules, either making them non-optional or removing them.
- Standardize on "mortal injury" - it was sometimes getting called "mortal wound".
- Remove everything about mounted combat, just isn't an exception worth exploring.
- Simplify chases.
- Replace WWN's XP system with a slightly-more-generous version of BX's.
- Rip out all of the downtime stuff; it's out of scope. No crafting, no modifying.
- Remove all of the wilderness exploration stuff. It's [not worth it](https://rancourt.substack.com/i/146342934/conclusions-and-suggestions). We want to spend time in dungeons playing adventures.
- Simplify WWN's armor list down to just leather/chain/plate.

### Attributions

Sovereign is built on a (much reduced) chassis of [Worlds Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348791/Worlds-Without-Number); taking its feat system, classes, spells, and combat. We sprinkle in [ACKs 2e](https://autarch.co/adventurer-conqueror-king/)'s top-notch economy. The bestiary is built off of [Those Outside the Walls](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/422653/Those-Outside-the-Walls--A-450-Monster-Bestiary), and many of the spell name changes are from [this community spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JVoO0kBs4OWH8sfQW0als0akRoeDFEdZejW4TF6x92w/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
