# Delver Creation

## Attributes

A Delver has six attributes ranging from 3 to 18, reflecting a range from
the minimum viable capacity for a playable character to the maximum normal
human level.

Three of these attributes are physical.

**Strength**, reflecting physical prowess, melee combat, carrying gear, and brute force.

**Dexterity**, reflecting speed, evasion, manual dexterity, reaction time, and combat initiative.

**Constitution**, reflecting hardiness, enduring injury, and tolerating large amounts of magical healing.

Three are mental attributes.

**Intelligence**, reflecting memory, reasoning, technical skills, and general education.

**Wisdom**, reflecting noticing things, making judgments, reading situations, and intuition.

**Charisma**, reflecting commanding, charming, attracting attention, and being taken seriously.

### Generating Attributes

To generate their six attributes, roll 3d6 in order, once for each attribute. At any point character creation you may substitute a score of 14 for one rolled score.

## Attribute Modifiers

Each attribute has a modifier, usually ranging from -2 to +2. This modifier is added to skill checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, Shock damage, and the relevant saving throw targets.

An attribute score of 3 has a modifier of -2. A score of 4-7 has a modifier of -1. A score of 8-13 has a modifier of +0. A score of 14-17 has a modifier of +1. A score of 18 has a modifier of +2.

Some Feats and abilities may add bonuses or penalties to an attribute’s base modifier. Such bonuses or penalties cannot increase the modifier above +2 or below -2. If an injury or character advancements alters an attribute, update the attribute’s modifier.

## Skills

A Delver’s skills reprsent their training. A newly-created Delver starts with a few trained skills and may gain more as the Delver advances in level.

### Interpretting Skill Levels

Skills are rated on a scale between untrained and level 4. Untrained (marked as `-` on a character sheet) represents an absence of training. Level 0 represents basic competence. Level 1 represents professional-level skill. Level 2 in a skill likely makes a character the best in a village or city block. Level 3 represents mastery, and likely makes the character one of the best in a city. Level 4 represents world-class skill.

### The Skill List

Skills may overlap in their application; the character may use either skill at their discretion.

- **Exert**: Run, swim, climb, jump, labor for long periods, throw things, or otherwise exert your physical strength, stamina, and coordination. Even a PC with poor physical attributes might have a good Exert skill reflecting athletic training and expertise in making the most of their available talents.
- **Heal**: Treat wounds, cure diseases, neutralize poisons, diagnose psychological health issues, and otherwise tend to the wounds of body and mind. - **Know**: Know matters of history, geography, natural science, zoology, and other academic fields appropriate to a sage or scholar. While some sages might specialize in particular fields, most learned folks have a broad range of understanding, and will rarely be unable to even attempt to answer a question relevant to this skill.
- **Lead**: Inspire others to follow your lead and believe in your plans and goals. Manage subordinates and keep them focused, loyal, and motivated in the face of danger or failure. A successful leader will keep their subordinate’s faith and confidence even when reason might make the leader’s plan appear questionable at best.
- **Magic**: Cast or analyze magic and know things about famous mages or notable magical events. Classes that can’t cast spells obtain only intellectual and scholarly benefits from this skill.
- **Notice**: Notice small details, impending ambushes, hidden features, or concealed objects. Detect subtle smells, sounds, or other sensory input.
- **Punch**: Fight unarmed or with natural body weaponry. Punch, kick, grapple, or otherwise brawl without the benefit of man-made tools. This mode of fighting is inefficient at best without a Feat to improve it, but it’s reliably non-lethal.
- **Shoot**: Fire a bow or crossbow or throw a hurled weapon. Maintain ranged weaponry and fletch arrows.
- **Sneak**: Move silently, hide in shadows, avoid notice, pick pockets, disguise yourself, pick locks, defeat traps, or otherwise overcome security measures.
- **Stab**: Fight with melee weapons or throw a hurled weapon. Maintain and identify weaponry.

## Starting Improvements

A newly-created Delver may make 4 total improvements to their Skills or Attributes. To improve an Attribute, raise it by 1 to a maximum of 18 and then recalculate its Modifier. To improve a Skill, raise its level by 1 to a maximum of 1.

A single Attribute or Skill can be improved multiple times.

## Core Competencies

Adventuring is a profession, and all Delvers have undergone extensive training to become 1st level. They can clean and sharpen weapons, set up camp, cook meals, ride mounts, perform first aid, know the value of coins, trade goods, treasure, and identify common magical effects and monsters.

## Classes

Delving is done in a party of specialists. A class represents the particular skills, abilities, or talents that make the Delver valuable to the party.

The three base classes are Expert, Mage, and Warrior. Each of these base classes has its own hit die, attack progression, and Feat advancement.

There are two kinds of classes: full classes and Partial classes. You may choose a single class, committing completely to that class’ profession. Alternatively, you may pick two Partial classes, mixing their abilities.

Choose either a full class or two Partial classes from the available [options](/classes).

To replicate the classic, well-rounded D&D party of Fighter, Wizard, Thief, Cleric, create a Warrior, High Mage, Expert, and Partial Warrior/Healer.

## Record Maximum Hit Points

Your character’s hit points measure their distance from defeat or death. If your character is reduced to zero hit points, they are either dying or incapacitated based on the nature of the injury.

A new character rolls the hit die for their class, adding their Constitution modifier to it. If they have chosen the Die Hard Focus they may add +2 to the roll. The final value for a given die cannot be less than 1 hit point.

A character gains hit points as they advance in character level, rerolling their prior levels and taking the new score if it’s higher, as explained in the rules section.

## Record Attack Bonus

Your character has a certain degree of basic combat competence based on their class. This bonus increases as you advance in character levels and is added to your attack roll.

A new character’s attack bonus is usually +0, though Full Warriors start with a +1 base attack bonus.

## Record Saving Throws

When faced with unusual dangers such as fireball explosions, toxic darts, pit traps, or magical curses, the character may need to make a saving throw to resist or mitigate the peril. Saving throws are rolled on a d20 and are explained in the rules section.

Physical saving throws are used to resist exhaustion, disease, poison, or other biological harms. A new character’s Physical save target is equal to 15 minus the better of their Strength or Constitution modifiers.

Evasion saving throws are used to avoid explosions, traps, or other dangers requiring fast reactions. A new character’s Evasion save target is equal to 15 minus the better of their Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers.

Mental saving throws are used to resist intangible spells, mental attacks, or other tests of willpower or self-control. A new character’s Mental save target is equal to 15 minus the better of their Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.

Luck saving throws are rolled when facing a danger that only blind chance can spare them from, such as landslide, bridge collapse, or a sniper’s random choice of victims. A new character’s Luck save target is always 15.

A character’s save targets all decrease by 1 point each time they advance an experience level.

## Mages Choose Starting Spells

Spellcasting full Mages begin play knowing four first-level spells and partial Mages begin play knowing two. Delvers with two partial spellcasting Mage classes, such as a partial Necromancer/partial High Mage know four. These spells may be chosen from any spell list available to them. A new High Mage, for example, would pick first-level spells from the High Magic spell list, while a new Elementalist could pick them from either the High Magic or Elementalist spells.

## Choose Starting Gear

Gain 3d6 x 10 gold to spend on gear or keep in your pocket.

## Record Weapon and Armor Statistics

Now that you know what kind of weaponry or armor your delver has,
take a moment to record the total hit bonus for your weaponry. This is equal to your attack bonus plus your relevant Stab, Shoot, or Punch skill, and the relevant attribute modifier for the weapon given on the weapon table. If two attributes are listed for a weapon, use whichever is better for you. If you lack even level-0 skill in the weapon, take a -2 hit penalty with it.

For each weapon’s damage and Shock, note down the information from the table. You add your attribute modifier to both damage rolls and Shock. Punch weapons or unarmed attacks can also add your Punch skill.

For your PC’s Armor Class, record the AC of the armor you usually wear. Unarmored humans have an AC of 10. Armor Class is modified by your Dexterity modifier.
