# Running The Game

This document is written for a fresh GM, but veteran GMs may still find useful ideas. Most of these ideas are not original, rather they have been consolidated from dozens of books and hundreds of [blogs](https://campaignwiki.org/osr/).

## Getting a Group Together

I *highly* recommend trying to play in-person. The easy way to do this is to ask friends to play. If that's not an option, or to fill in extra seats at the table, the [looking for group subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/) works. I can personally vouch for it. There are other services like [startplaying.games](https://startplaying.games/search).

Finally, it's worth advertising at your friendly local game store. They often let people reserve tables or have a dedicated night. If you google "friendly local game store near me", you'll hopefully get some nearby places. If you don't, experiment with... moving to a city. Once you find one, call them and ask about D&D, that's usually way faster than trying to navigate bespoke (and frequently out of date) websites.

## Actually Playing

Get people together, *noncommittally* to see if they like playing in your game. Make sure they're safe, and that you'd be comfortable having them in your house. I like to have lunch with people at a restaurant before inviting them to my home (sort of like how dating works), but meeting at a game store in the beginning works too.

Once you have a group together, **fully commit** to a schedule. There's a line from ACKs 2e that I like a lot:

> If you’re planning to start a successful campaign, you need to explain to your friends that you are not hosting a series of social events. You are starting an intramural sports team and asking them if they’d like to be on the team.

At social events, it's okay for people to bail or show up late. In team sports, it's *not okay*. They're *letting the team down*. This is a *commitment*. If that scares them off, that's fine! Find someone who *really* wants to play. Lots of people *pay* for a game master, no one pays for players. Plenty of people really do want to be there; find those people. Setting this expectation properly will save more grief than anything else.

Even so, stuff will come up. Birthday parties, holidays, travel, etc. Make it clear ahead of time that you'll play so long as half of the players can make it. Decide up front what to do with the characters of the players who aren't there. Some folks are unattached, and don't mind if someone else pilots their character. Some people *love* their character, or no one feels comfortable accepting that responsibility. In these cases, I handwave those characters away. Trying to narratively explain how these characters pop in and out isn't worth it. Just tell the players this. For example:

**GM**: You check the door - it's locked. What do you do?

**Alice**: Dang - Bob's (who is on vacation) character Bogdan is the one with all the [Sneak](/rules#sneak). Can his character pick the lock?

**GM**: No - though I think Bob should be around for next session. Bogdan *just isn't here* and I'm not going to try to figure out how to explain the dissapearance or his smooth reappearance next week, I've tried before and it's always too weird.

**Alice**: Hah - fine, so maybe we... bash the door in?

## Handling Interpersonal Problems

Just talk to them. Seriously. Don't post about it on social media and ask for advice. Don't do mean stuff to their characters as retribution. Tell them how your behavior is impacting you, and suggest other ways for them to behave instead. Listen to them. Not everyone is a good fit for every table. It's totally fine to let folks know that they aren't a good fit for the table. It doesn't need to be dramatic and shouldn't be (sort of like dating).

## Necessary Materials

- [Pens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXWGWE). I personally use a [Pilot Prera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016YYKUA).
- [Pencils](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQQ05JA).
- [Paper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FV0F8H8).
- [Dice](https://www.amazon.com/Chessex-001LBCHX-Pound-O-Dice/dp/B008C0KXYS). I *highly* recommend folks use a different color for each size of dice as they're learning.
- [Card Stock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FX5LCXK). For item and spell handouts.
- [Scissors](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Multipurpose-Titanium-Stainless/dp/B01BRGU8R0). For cutting out character sheets, items and spell handouts.
- [A Battlemap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQHECUR). This one is dry-erase compatible, which is great.  For travel, I like [silicone maps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0763QJQ8C).
- [Dry Erase Markers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T3ROM9G). If you have a wet erase battlemap, get wet erase markers instead.
- [Meeples](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BZ36NYJ). Label each color 1 through 10 with a Sharpie and use them for monsters.
- Delver Icons: [Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016DSBNY4) + [Epoxy Stickers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFRWIRQ) + [Hole Punch](https://www.amazon.com/Bira-Circle-Craft-Crafting-Scrapbooking/dp/B07B43X316). From [JP Coovert's Youtube](https://youtu.be/LBZPi4oKlCQ?si=mTP5tiOjJyb1ITeu).
- [Printer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09961WKKS). Good for printing modules, character sheets, maps, handouts, etc.
- [Awl](https://www.amazon.com/General-Tools-818-Hardwood-Scratch/dp/B00004T7R3). Sewn digest modules lay much more nicely than stapled ones.
- [Needle and Thread](https://www.amazon.com/Simthread-Purpose-Thread-Polyester-Yards/dp/B0B9FQ2QN4). For binding modules.
- [3 Ring Binder](https://www.amazon.com/Samsill-Economy-Ring-Binder-5-Round/dp/B07FKXHP1H). Some modules are natively printed on big paper (like Castle Xyntillan) and printing them out digest style makes the font painfully small. For these, we use a hole punch and a 3 ring binder. Additionally, GM notes go in a separate 3-ring binder.
- [3 Hole Punch](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Hole-Punch-Sheet-Capacity/dp/B0879YNTTP).

The specific product recommendations are all optional. At a higher level, you need some way to:

- Record character information (pencil and paper)
- Generate random numbers (dice)
- Take GM notes (pen, paper, 3-ring binder)
- Read adventures (printer and paper)
- Prepare adventures (pen, printed adventure)
- Represent a battle (battle map, markers, meeples, delver icons)

As long as you have these things handled, you're good.

## Preparing an Adventure

Read the module cover to cover. Then, start back at the beginning and try to mentally answer each one of these questions:

- How does the game start?
- Does each faction have a goal?
- For each room:
  - Is it clear what I should say when the players enter the room?
  - Does each trap and secret door have a mechanism and tell?
  - Does it have all of the information necessary to run it?
  - Do the details in the room have internal consistency?
  - Are stat blocks accurate and complete?
  - Do magic items have a description?
- Do the bespoke mechanics work in play?
- Does the key match the map?
- Is the amount of treasure appropriate for the risk?
- Can I replace random values with pre-rolled results?

For an *involved* demonstration of this process, check out my [Audit of Tower Silveraxe](https://rancourt.substack.com/p/audit-tower-silveraxe).

### How Does the Game Start?

Some dungeons, like Borshak's Lair, *just* detail a dungeon. Here, you're using [hard framing](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/31509/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-pacing) to narrate how they found out about the dungeon, what information they gathered, their trip to the dungeon, and what it looks from the outside.

For instance

> At Slarkeron the Wizard's behest, you venture past the Valley of Barzak Bragoth, around Lake Shimron, and just north of Tol Bandur to the ancient tomb of Lord Helmdar.
>
> Slarkeron says that a rival named Tim the Moonslayer claimed the tomb and created a tunnel complex for his crazed experiments but hasn't been heard from in decades.
>
> You arrive at a stairway leading deep under the earth. The walls are moist but not slimy; the air is cool, damp, and silent. What do you do?

Other adventures, like [The Evils of Illmire](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/343439) detail a town and multiple nearby dungeons. It is *usually* safe to start the players in the town, let them gather information about the adventure, and choose where to go. If the town is weakly detailed, nothing interesting to do in town, or there's no real choice about where to go, we [skip forward](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/31509/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-pacing) to the dungeon entrance, letting the town fade into the background as a place for the adventures to return to to resupply or recover [System Strain](/rules#system-strain).

If this is the first session, **strongly** consider starting them at the entrance to a dungeon rather than in a town.

### Factions

I love GFC's [take on factions](https://guccifuligincloak.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-four-blanks-method-of-faction.html). The summary is that you should be able to write

> [FACTION] wants [MOTIVATION], but [OBSTACLE]; therefore, [METHOD OF SURMOUNTING OBSTACLE]

for each faction. If the faction doesn’t want anything, it’s hard to know how to get them to act or how they’ll react. If nothing is stopping them from getting what they want, why don’t they have it? If they’re not trying to remove their obstacle, what are they doing, and do they actually want the thing?

Read through the factions in the adventure (and dungeon), and make sure they're at least this complex. If they aren't, flesh them out! The [Parley](/rules#parley) information has some sample motivations for each kind of creature:

**Dragons** want food, territory, treasure, and domination.

**Humanoids** want territory, treasure, domination, or higher order concepts like fairness, kindness, loyalty, obediency, and sanctity.

**Giants** are obsessed in their place in the hierarchy of Giants, and anything that will help them climb that hierarchy.

**Undead** and **constructs** are compelled by whatever directive created them.

**Fiends** want to cause suffering.

**Aberrations** have intentionally alien, unintelligible motives.

**Fey** have emotional motives, often following dream logic or the [seven deadly sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins) (gluttony, lust, greed, sorrow, wrath, sloth, pride).

It's helpful if the motivations, obstacles, and methods of different factions overlap somehow. Have two factions want the same thing, or two different factions are blocked by the same obstacle.

A neat way of visualizing this is given by [Murkdice](https://murkdice.substack.com/p/make-factions-fight).
