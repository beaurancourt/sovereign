# Spells

High Mages, Necromancers, and Elementalists are capable of casting spells. NPC wizards may also have access to spellcasting, though NPCs seldom have classes.

Spells ranked in power from level one, the relatively weakest, to level five, the most potent.

The common corpus of ancient spells is known as High Magic. These spells are the common heritage of all spellcasting mages, and any spellcasting mage can learn and use them.

Elementalists or Necromancers also have bodies of spells specific to their tradition. Only they can learn or cast these spells.

## Learning a Spell

High Mages automatically learn two new spells automatically each time they advance a level. Elementalists and Necromancers learn one new spell automatically each time they advance a level.

Additing additional spells to a Mage's spellbook (from a tutor or a scroll, or another mage's spellbook) requires one week per spell level, less one week per level of the learner’s [Magic](/rules#magic), down to a minimum of one day. They must possess to their spellbook to prepare the spell later.

If this spellbook is lost, the mage can re-create it, but it takes as much time to re-scribe each spell as it would to learn it in the first place. No special costs are required in silver or materials.

A mage must be able to cast the spell in order to learn it. A novice mage can cast only first level spells, so they can learn only first level spells.

## Preparing a Spell

Once a spell is learned, the mage must prepare the spell for casting. The number of spells a mage can prepare at once varies with their experience level, from as few as two or three at first level to as many as twelve when at tenth level. The mage may prepare any spell they have in their spellbook; there’s no obligation to prepare a certain number of low-level spells should the mage wish to fill all their available “slots” with their most powerful magics and run the risk of lacking some lesser, yet more useful spell.

Preparing a new set of spells takes an hour, and can only be done after a good night’s (the same sort of rest that recovers [System Strain](/rules#system-strain); must be in a settlement) rest, when the mage’s mind is most fresh and malleable. Once spells have been prepared they remain so indefinitely until replaced with a different set of magics.

## Casting Prepared Spells

Once a set of spells is prepared, the mage may cast them at their leisure. Casting a spell usually requires a [Main Action](/combat#main-action), a free hand, and vocalizations as loud as normal conversation. The process is obviously occult to any onlookers, but it's impossible to tell which spell a mage is casting by meerly looking.

Casting a spell requires focus and undisturbed concentration. If a mage has taken damage or has been severely jostled in a round, they cannot cast magic that round. Thus, a mage who acts late in a round runs the risk of being hurt and having their concentration spoiled, forcing them to do something other than cast a spell when their turn comes around.

Spells and Arts cannot be cast while wearing armor, restrictive clothing, or wielding a shield.

A mage can cast only so many spells each day before needing a good night’s rest (the same sort of rest that recovers [System Strain](/rules#system-strain); must be in a settlement) to recover. Novices can cast only one spell, while masters can manage six. The spell to be cast may be selected from any prepared by the mage; the same power can be used to invoke a mighty fifth-level spell or a relatively modest first-level incantation. The same spell may be cast more than once, if the mage has multiple castings left for the day.

Partial Mages are more limited than more focused specialists. They are able to cast fewer spells each day and the maximum level of spell they can cast is also significantly lower as compared to an equivalent full Mage. The total spells they can prepare for the day are also fewer than that of a full Mage. When they cast the spells, however, any level-based effects also use their full level, so a third-level Partial Necromancer’s Arcane Spark does `3d8` damage, just as a full Necromancer would.

### Creatures, Targets, and Visibility

Many spells or powers specify particular targets or creatures, or require that a target be visible. For purposes of these spells, “creature” means any animate entity, whether living, undead, or synthetic. Plants do not qualify as creatures unless they’re some sort of plant monster.

A spell that can be aimed or used on one or more targets can include the caster as one such potential target, unless the spell indicates otherwise. If a spell specifies that it applies only to “chosen targets”, the mage can pick and choose; otherwise all in the area are affected indiscriminately.

A “visible” target is a target the mage can see or whose exact location is obvious to the caster. If a maximum range isn’t given, assume it’s can be no more than 600' away from the wizard.

## High Magic Spells

### Level 1 - High Magic

#### Arcane Spark
A thaumic discharge is focused on a single visible creature within one hundred feet per caster level, wreathing them in a lethal mantle of crackling energy.

NPC targets with only 1 HD are slain. Otherwise, the target suffers `1d8` damage per caster level, with a [Physical](/rules#physical) save for half.

#### Blunt Contact
This spell may be cast in two different forms.

If it targets a **creature** within 200 feet, the target becomes partially immune to physical weapons; any weapon hit on them requires the attacker make a successful [Physical](/rules#physical) save or the hit is negated. This effect lasts for one round per two caster levels, rounded up, and can’t target the caster.

If it targets a visible **weapon** within two hundred feet, that weapon is rendered entirely harmless and unable to inflict damage for the rest of the turn, with no saving throw.

The spell may only affect a given target or weapon once per [Turn](/rules#turn) and natural body weapons aren’t affected.

#### Control Animal
The mage targets a visible, normal, non-magical animal or insect, obtaining temporary control of the beast and the ability to share its senses. The animal gains a telepathic bond with the caster, obeying any non-suicidal command and allowing the mage to perceive everything it perceives. The beast will not fight for the caster, but can perform complex actions entirely out of character for it while under the mage’s control.

The mage must focus to share the beast’s senses, requiring a [Main Action](/combat#main-action) and leaving the mage unable to act physically while so focused. The spell lasts until the mage releases the beast, it is dispelled, or it is cast again.

#### Create Illusion
The mage creates a illusion at a visible location within 100 feet per caster level. The illusion can occupy a number of 10-foot cubes equal to the caster’s level and can fool sight, hearing, smell, and even touch.

If onlookers have no reason to believe the illusion is false, they will unconsciously conform to its apparent physical qualities, halting before walls, reeling from imagined blows, and seeing their clothing burnt by illusory flames. The illusion will behave and act on its own in accordance with the caster’s intentions for it, but it cannot go more than a hundred feet from where it was conjured.

Illusory monsters fight with the caster’s attack bonus, do `1d8` damage, have AC 10, and vanish if struck. There can be no more than one active illusionary attacker per two caster levels. Foes brought to zero HP fall unconscious and wake up ten minutes later with 1 HP.

Creatures convinced the illusion is false can make a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw each round to reject its psychic influences, becoming immune to its effects. The illusion lasts until dispelled, the caster drops it, or this spell is cast again.

#### Destroy Plants
Wood, linen, cotton, rope, and other plant or fungus-derived matter is annihilated by a wave of entropic force that washes through an area near the caster.

The mage targets a point within one hundred feet per caster level and designates a number of contiguous 10-foot cubes within that area equal to or less than their caster level. All non-magical plant matter within that area immediately erodes away to dust. Enchanted objects of plant matter cannot be affected, but ordinary plant-based clothing, bows, or wooden-hafted weapons will be destroyed. If used against plant-based monsters, the spell does `1d10` damage per caster level, with a [Physical](/rules#physical) save for half.

#### Detect Thoughts
The mage focuses on a visible living creature within 100 feet per caster level. For the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn), they immediately receive an impression of the target’s surface thoughts and interests, understanding them regardless of any lack of a shared language.

The caster may ask one question of the target’s memories per caster level, but doing so risks breaking the spell; the target can make a [Mental](/rules#mental) save before answering each question and the spell ends if the save is successful. These questions can only query memories, not compel any exercise of judgment. This spell is very subtle in its casting, and requires no gestures or audible incantations.

#### Dominate Person
The mage targets a visible living creature within 100 feet. The subject must immediately make a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw at a penalty equal to the caster’s [Magic](/rules#magic) or become enthralled to the caster’s will. Such victims will obey any physical commands issued by the caster, barring ones that seem suicidal or patently meant to result in their death.

The caster cannot order the creature to answer questions or perform acts that require independent judgment, nor to use non-physical abilities or spells, but it will fight for the caster or to defend its own life. Enchanted victims appear torpid and dazed, and will act only to defend themselves or satisfy their needs.

The spell lasts until dispelled, or until the caster dies or releases them. Every time this spell is cast, however, all prior subjects get an immediate unmodified [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to throw it off. If the creature has more HP than the caster has levels, it gets an unmodified saving throw to end the effect the first time each day it’s ordered to do something it finds strongly objectionable.

#### Dominate Sense
The caster targets a visible creature within two hundred feet. The target gets a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to resist; on a failure, one sense of the caster’s choice is entirely under the caster’s control for the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn), while a success leaves them bound only for the next round.

Any false impression may be given, or any true one concealed, and a creature may be left effectively blinded or deafened. Distracting tactile sensations can force the victim to make a [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw in order to act each round. Blinded creatures can’t make ranged attacks and roll all melee attack rolls twice, taking the worst result. If a creature thinks itself in mortal peril its excitement allows it to make a [Mental](/rules#mental) save to throw off the spell at the end of each round.

#### Invisibility
The mage chooses up to one visible willing target per caster level provided they are within 100 feet. The targets and all they wear or carry become perfectly transparent.

Missile attacks against invisible foes are largely impossible, and melee attacks against them usually suffer a -4 penalty to attack rolls. The spell lasts for up to an hour per caster level, but it breaks if a subject performs some violent motion, such as running, attacking, or casting a spell. Once broken for one subject, it breaks for all.

#### See Magic
The mage opens up their mind to the presence of occult energies. For one [Turn](/rules#turn) per character level, they are capable of seeing active magical effects, curses, or other enchantments as colored auras or patterns of light.

They may identify magical items and get a one-sentence description of their purpose or most significant powers, and get more sophisticated answers with successful WIS/[Magic](/rules#magic) skill checks at difficulties of 8 or more depending on the subtlety of the enchantment. Mages with prepared spells are visible to the caster, though which spells the subject might have prepared is not knowable. As a side effect of this spell, the ambient thaumic currents cast enough quasi-light to allow the caster to see normally even in perfect darkness.

#### Sleep
The mage designates a visible point within two hundred feet. A silent, invisible burst of soporific influence erupts from that point, targeting all living creatures within a twenty-foot radius. All such targets with 4 or fewer HD within that area fall unconscious instantly, and are roused only by damage or by a [Main Action](/combat#main-action) used to kick them awake.

If not roused, they revive at the end of the [Turn](/rules#turn). Entities that do not sleep are immune to this spell.

#### Speed
Unlike most spells, Speed may be cast as a [Free Action](/combat#free-action), targeting up to one visible willing creature per caster level within one hundred feet.

Enchanted creatures become incredibly fleet of foot, doubling their usual ground movement rate and becoming capable of running up walls and across ceilings without falling, provided they end their round upright on a navigable surface.

They may also move away from melee opponents without needing to make a [Disengage](/combat#disengage-main) to avoid a parting attack, and may pass through and around armed foes who do not completely physically block their path. The spell lasts for the remainder of the [Turn](/rules#turn) and adds 1 [System Strain](/rules#system-strain) to those who take advantage of it.

#### Stasis
Stasis may be cast as a [Free Action](/combat#free-action) and targets a single willing or helpless creature the caster is touching. The subject is shifted out of the flow of conventional time, freezing and being limned in a pale sepia light. They and all their carried possessions are rendered impervious to all non-magical harm and are frozen in temporal stasis until the spell ends or is dispelled. Enchanted creatures are quite light, counting as only four items of Encumbrance due to their unwieldiness.

The spell ends when the mage releases it, or up to a maximum of one day per caster level. If cast on himself, the mage cannot end it before the full duration expires.


### Level 2 - High Magic

#### Destroy Earth
Stone, earth, sod, sand, or other largely mineral material is reduced to a faint spray of fine dust, though metal and enchanted objects are unaffected.

The caster chooses up to one contiguous 10-foot cube per caster level in a visible area within one hundred feet per caster level, causing all such stone or mineral material within the cubes to disappear. Such rapid destruction may cause larger structures to collapse. If used against rock-based monsters, the spell does `1d10` damage per caster level, with a [Physical](/rules#physical) save for half.

#### Dimension Door
A visible target within a hundred feet is immediately teleported to any visible, solid resting point within a half-mile, provided the target point has enough room to accept them.

Unattended objects can be teleported by the spell, but they can be no larger than a horse. Unwilling creatures targeted by this spell make a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to resist; on a success, it is the caster who is transported to the intended destination instead.

#### Dispel Magic
The caster sweeps away all unwanted magical effects and enchantments within a twenty-foot radius, centered on any visible point within one hundred feet per level.

If the magical effect was cast by a creature with equal or fewer HD, the effect is negated automatically. Otherwise, make an opposed INT/[Magic](/rules#magic) skill check, with higher-leveled caster gaining a +2 bonus and the dispeller getting a +1 bonus.

This spell is not strong enough to permanently suppress standing magical effects, and requires the aforementioned contested roll to temporarily suppressing them. If successful, the effect is negated for `1d6` rounds. If cast on a very large enchantment, only the portion within the spell’s zone of effect is suppressed.

#### Elemental Shield
The caster and up to three visible allies per caster level are shielded from hostile elemental energies, becoming immune to mundane extremes of heat, cold, natural acids, and electrical discharges. Against magical harm of this nature, they automatically take only half the damage they normally would, or none if they make a successful [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw. This spell lasts for one hour per caster level.

#### Fake Death
Fake Death may be cast as an [Instant Action](/combat#instant-action) and targets either the caster or a willing visible target. It can only be used in immediate response to an injury that reduces the target to zero HP.

The target suffers dramatic and ostentatiously obvious death, with mortal blows cleaving them asunder or gorily butchering them. They are dead to all mundane or magical examination. Up to two hours later however, at the target’s discretion, the various remains of the target flow back together and restore their body with two HP per caster level and two additional [System Strain](/rules#system-strain) points gained.

If the target’s remains are intentionally scattered widely, incinerated, or entirely eaten, however, they cannot revive. The subject is aware of their surroundings while “dead”.

#### Floating Palanquin
This spell calls forth a floating palanquin of ornately-carved green stone. A slim three-foot-tall statue of a faceless entity stands at the center of the platform, while four slender pillars rise at the corners, the roof and sides being draped by metallic golden cloth.

The palanquin itself is twelve feet long and eight wide, with room enough for several people to sit on it. It floats at shoulder-height above the ground or a liquid surface below. It does not move of its own, but may be pulled along by even one human-sized bearer. The total burden on the palanquin cannot exceed more than two thousand pounds, or it sinks to the ground.

It lasts until dusk, dawn, or until the statue of the god is struck or insulted, whichever comes first.

#### Haste
The caster imbues one visible ally per caster level with a burst of tremendous speed as their localized time begins to flow more rapidly.

For `1d4+1` rounds, all subjects get an extra [Main Action](/combat#main-action). This [Main Action](/combat#main-action) may not be used to cast spells or use arts. This spell severely taxes those who take advantage of it, adding 1 [System Strain](/rules#system-strain) for each round in which the recipient takes the bonus action.

#### Scry
A pool of water, mirror, open flame, polished crystal, or other luminous or reflective surface is used to peer at a distant location. The location must either be within one hundred feet per caster level or be a location the caster has physically occupied before.

The caster perceives the location as if he were standing at the targeted point within it, seeing and hearing events there as if he were present. This spell cannot scry locations that have been magically warded, and scrying the same location repeatedly is hindered by the resonance created by the spell.

The spell cannot perceive the same area twice within the same week, or position its target point so as to overlap a prior area with its perceptions within that time. If a target present in the area has more HD than the caster has levels, they get a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to get an uncanny sense of being watched, something that will alert those cognizant of this spell.

This spell lasts until the caster performs some action other than focusing on the scrying.

#### Shield of Daggers
A visible willing creature within thirty feet is surrounded by a whirl of razor-sharp energy shards.

Anyone who attempt to touch the target or make a melee attack against them must make an [Evasion](/rules#evasion) saving throw or suffer `1d6` damage plus the caster’s level before resolving their attack. The field of blades is indiscriminate and will affect even allies trying to touch the target.

The blades remain as long as the target gives up a [Move Action](/combat#move-action) each [Round](/rules#round) in order to avoid disrupting them from within, up to a maximum of one [Turn](/rules#turn).

#### Suggestion
The caster makes a single one-sentence statement as part of casting this spell, a process which is subtle enough to appear as no more than ordinary conversation.

All who hear the caster speak within a forty-foot radius must make a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw or come to immediately believe the statement is true unless it seems physically impossible to them or it is emotionally intolerable to believe.

The listeners must be able to understand the caster’s language, and the caster may exempt up to two targets per caster level from this delusion when casting the spell, so as to avoid beguiling their companions.

The spell’s effects linger for one hour per caster level, after which the believers will be no more persuaded of the fact than events or their own common sense would allow.

#### Summon Familiar
This spell conjures up an intelligent familiar for the caster, one with 1 HP per caster level, an AC of 14, a ground movement rate of 30’ per action, saving throws the same as the caster, a +0 skill modifier, and no effective attack.

The familiar always adopts the same shape for the same caster, though the initial casting sets this to any shape the caster wishes provided it’s no larger than a small human. The familiar retains a telepathic connection with its creator and will obey any command it is given, including suicidal ones. It can perform any action that a competent human servant could.

If the familiar is slain, it fades away, but can be called forth again by the spell. The familiar retains its memories of what happens while it’s summoned, and develops its own personality in time.

The familiar remains in existence until dawn following the spell’s casting or until dismissed by the caster.

#### Vine Growth
A vast wall of thick, heavy vines and other plant life blooms from a visible point within one hundred feet per caster level.

The wall is up to twenty feet high and three feet thick and runs for as much as twenty feet in width per caster level. The vine wall can be shaped as the caster wishes within the spell’s area of effect, so long as it’s contiguous, and may be laid horizontally if a bridge or roof is desired.

Enemies must inflict five damage per caster level to cut a man-sized hole in the vines, and they must be using weapons or means that could actually cut through a wooden wall to do any meaningful harm. The vines may be covered in long, vicious thorns to discourage climbing, inflicting `2d6` damage on any creature who tries to climb over it.

If the vine wall is summoned from earth that could plausibly support plant life, it remains until dispelled or until it dies naturally. If called from bare stone or other infertile soils, it withers away to dust at the end of the [Turn](/rules#turn).

### Level 3 - High Magic

#### Arctic Circle
The caster invokes a gust of deepest winter on a point within one hundred feet per level, freezing everything in a radius up to ten feet per caster level.

All liquids freeze solid down to a depth of two feet and all living creatures not impervious to arctic cold must suffer `1d6` damage per two levels of the caster, with a [Physical](/rules#physical) save for half damage. Those who fail their [Physical](/rules#physical) saves are numbed by the cold and lose their [Move Action](/combat#move-action) each round for the next `1d4` rounds.

The frozen area warms again at the usual rate for the surrounding environment.

#### Augury
The caster probes the near currents of fate to discern the likely immediate outcome of an action.

The caster describes a particular action they or a comrade intend to presently undertake, whereupon the GM tells them what is most likely to happen in consequence within the first five minutes after the action, as the GM thinks it most probable.

This spell cannot be used more than once a week on the same general topic.

#### Curse of Boils
A single visible living creature is smote with a hideous curse of torment. Boils erupt all over their body, blood weeps from their orifices, tumors engorge their flesh, and all of their hair falls out almost instantaneously.

If they perform any vigorous physical action save movement they incur two points of damage per caster level from the effects of the curse, damage which can be suffered no more than once per round by a target.

A creature may spend its [Main Action](/combat#main-action) to attempt a [Physical](/rules#physical) save to throw off the curse, but on a failure, the curse remains for the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn). If the creature has fewer HD than the caster has levels, a single failed save means the curse lasts indefinitely, until dispelled or until the caster releases them.

#### Fear
A wave of numbing terror sweeps over all enemies of the caster within forty feet.

They must immediately make a [Mental](/rules#mental) save, with failure causing flight. Those who succeed at the check suffer one point of damage per caster level from demoralization and despair, with those brought to zero HP instead regaining 1 HP and fleeing.

This spell has no effect on creatures that feel no fear.

#### Magic Bomb
A flattened disc of tremendous heat, sound, and shock is triggered at a visible point within fifty feet per caster level, erupting in a twenty-foot radius eight feet in height.

Everything within the area suffers `1d8` damage from flame, concussion, and sonic shock per caster level, with an [Evasion](/rules#evasion) save for half. If used in a space less than 40 feet in width, the explosion is channeled through adjacent spaces and passages for an additional `1d6` x 10 feet.

#### Magic Wall
The caster must form some sort of line as part of this spell’s invocation, either with dropped powders or a trace drawn in the dirt or a more permanent inlay into a floor. The caster can make such a line as part of a [Move Action](/combat#move-action, tracing it out or scattering powder as they go. The line itself may be no longer than twenty feet per caster level, and may be straight or curved as the caster wishes.

Once it has been drawn, Magic Wall empowers the line with the ability to ward off a particular target and prevent them or their powers from crossing or being made to cross the line, as if it were a physical wall. The caster can nominate any kind of target to be warded that could be distinguished without need for knowing their thoughts, such as “humans” or “non-humans” or “men wearing the livery of the baron”.

The barrier extends a hundred feet upward and ten feet downward and blocks any attack or magical power used by those warded. If the excluded creatures are attacked or targeted by powers from the other side of the barrier, however, the entire field shatters. The barrier lasts until dispelled, the caster drops it, or until one hour has passed per caster level.

#### Message
This spell calls forth a floating set of colored glass chimes. The caster alone may strike them, producing sounds of great subtlety and clarity. The caster may allow anyone within ten miles per level to hear the music, or may make it inaudible to anyone save specific targets within range.

Such is the expressiveness of the chimes that those who hear them instantly understands the caster’s desired message, however abstract. If the caster strikes the chimes violently as a [Main Action](/combat#main-action), they shatter them, causing a deafening clamor that does `3d6` damage to all non-deaf targets within forty feet except for the caster.

The chimes persist until shattered or the [Turn](/rules#turn) ends.

#### Passwall
The caster touches a solid non-magical barrier when casting this spell. A 10 foot cube of the barrier then becomes perfectly transparent on the caster’s side, allowing them to see and hear whatever lies on the other side as if it were well-lit and visible.

Optionally, the caster may make the barrier insubstantial for one round per caster level, allowing anyone to pass or shoot through it from either side. The barrier always appears solid and opaque from the other side, even while the caster is peering through. If someone is caught within the barrier when it becomes solid again, they’re spat out on the nearest clear side and suffer `2d10` damage.

The spell ends when the caster ceases to touch the barrier or immediately after it stops being insubstantial.

#### Transfer Life
The caster renders the forms and life energy of up to one visible subject per caster level into something plastic and transferable.

HP, poisons, and diseases can be transferred from one creature to another, if both are willing or helplessly bound, healing up to the maximum allowed HP of the target creature.

Body parts can be exchanged or gifted so long as each subject retains at least half of their original body. A willing target can even be absorbed into the body of another subject of the spell, disappearing into them until the spell ends or they choose to spring back out, fully-equipped. Assimilated subjects can continue to see and hear what goes on outside their carrier. A given subject can absorb up to five other human-sized targets.

The spell lasts until dispelled, released, or one hour per caster level has passed, though transferred HP or afflictions do not return to their original subject. If a subject is killed while “borrowing” another’s body parts, those parts do not return.

#### Transfiguration
A brief incantation transforms one visible, willing target per caster level into a perfect simulacrum of any humanoid creature the caster has seen before, whether a specific individual or a general type.

No special abilities are granted by this transformation, but the target will perfectly resemble a chosen individual, including in voice and scent. Their non-magical clothing will transform to whatever clothing is appropriate to the target, and they will gain an intuitive ability to speak and understand the target’s native tongue.

The spell lasts until dawn of the day after casting it, whereupon the targets and any transformed clothing revert back to their original seeming.

#### Wind Walk
The caster and up to one visible ally per caster level are briefly granted the ability to move in three dimensions, being able to walk and run upward into the air as easily as along flat ground.

For the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn), those affected can move in such a way, remaining suspended in the air after their movement for the round. When the spell ends, either naturally or upon being dispelled, all affected targets float gently to the ground.

Optionally, the caster can instead use this spell on one visible flying creature per caster level, which must make a [Physical](/rules#physical) save at a penalty equal to the caster’s [Magic](/rules#magic) or be forced to land as they had fallen half the distance they had descended. For the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn), such creatures remain grounded and unable to fly.

### Level 4 - High Magic

#### Control Wind
Conjure a fierce gust of wind in a line a hundred feet long and thirty feet wide.

All creatures of man-size or smaller must make [Physical](/rules#physical) saves or be bowled over and blown back thirty feet, losing their next round’s [Main Action](/combat#main-action) and suffering `1d6` damage. Light wooden constructions or similar structures are flattened by the wind.

If used outdoors, the spell can instead control the local weather, transforming the quarter-mile around the caster into any climate found normally at that location at any point during the year. The spell cannot summon a tornado or other extreme weather, but it can call rain and conventional storms sufficient to cause flooding in areas prone to it. The gust of wind is instantaneous, but the weather change lasts for one hour per caster level before reverting to its natural state.

#### Delayed Dispel Magic
The caster sets up a triggered resonance of dispelling magic which may later be invoked as an [Instant Action](/combat#instant-action). Until the next dawn, the mage may negate magic as if with a [Dispel Magic](#dispel-magic---level-4) spell as an [Instant Action](/combat#instant-action). Once this negation is triggered, the spell ends.

#### Geas
A single visible living creature is struck with a grim geas, forcing it to comply with a particular command or else suffer a progressively-worse affliction.

The caster lays one single-sentence command on the target that is neither suicidal, indefinitely imprecise, nor likely physically impossible for them to comply with. Thus, the caster could geas a man to kill his son or never seek to harm his lord, but he could not reasonably command a peasant to become king or bind someone to forever after comply with a master’s arbitrary commands.

If the target then defies that geas or unreasonably delays its execution, they suffer an agonizing progressive wasting disease that will inevitably kill them in `1d6` weeks, applying -2 to their attack rolls and -1 to skill checks for each week that passes and halving their maximum HP. If they again begin complying with the geas afterwards or if the curse is lifted, the disease halts and reverses itself at the same rate it progressed.

An active target can make a [Mental](/rules#mental) save to resist this spell, but they cannot if they are restrained, unconscious, or otherwise subdued. The curse lasts until dispelled or the caster lifts it.

#### Greater Dominate Person
This spell can only be applied to a helpless or restrained living victim, who gets a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to resist it and be forever after immune to its effects.

On a failure, the target becomes hopelessly subject to the caster via a series of psychic fetters, obediently carrying out their will. The target must be able to understand the caster’s wishes, but will obey them to the best of its intelligence, capability, and initiative. They must make a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to resist performing even suicidal acts.

The spell lasts until it is dispelled or the caster releases the target. A caster can have no more creatures under this spell than twice their level or HD; if this number is exceeded, the earliest thrall is freed first.

Creatures under the effect of Greater Dominate Person display numerous small tics and magically-compelled quirks of behavior that may provoke puzzlement in casual observers and will give away the mental influence entirely to an onlooker with at least [Magic](/rules#magic)-0 who can observe them for at least an hour.

#### Pull Object
The contents of single visible target are extracted and placed in the caster’s hands.

If used on a cabinet, backpack, pocket, or other such container it can be no larger than an armoire, and the caster can choose whether or not to receive any particular object from inside it, being instantly appraised of its contents when the spell is cast.

If used on a creature, it attempts to tear out the subject’s innards; if the subject has equal or fewer HD than the caster, it must make a [Physical](/rules#physical) save or die instantly. Whether or not it perishes, it suffers `1d10` damage per caster level, with a [Physical](/rules#physical) save for half.

#### Rewind
The caster may invoke this spell as an [Instant Action](/combat#instant-action) on any single creature within one hundred feet. Time is rolled back slightly, allowing them to replay their current round of action as if it never occurred, though all involved retain a memory of what originally happened.

This spell is only useful on targets that are currently taking their round’s actions; once they’ve finished for the round and another creature has started acting, it is too late to benefit from this spell. If the target is unwilling to roll back their action, they make a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to resist the spell.

#### Rift
The caster opens a short-ranged spatial rift between two points within one hundred feet per level, provided they can see or have physically occupied both points at some prior time and provided the two points are at least twenty feet apart.

The rift forms a gateway that connects the two points, large enough to drive a cart through, and allows subjects on either side to see through and pass through the gate. Ambient environmental qualities such as liquids or atmospheres will not pass through the portal; only intentionally-directed creatures and objects will transfer.

The portal remains open for up to one round per caster level, but can be shut as an [Instant Action](/combat#instant-action) by the caster. Creatures partially in a rift when it closes are spat out on the far side.

#### Summon Creature
The caster conjures up a semi-real phantasmal creature in any shape or appearance they desire, provided it is no larger than an ox.

The servitor is as intelligent as a human and will obey the caster with fearless and suicidal devotion, having 4 HD, 20 HP, AC 15, a movement rate of 30’ per action, a +1 skill modifier, saves of 13+, and a +6/`1d8` damage melee attack with 2/AC 15 Shock. As the creature is partly phantasmal, the damage it inflicts cannot kill a subject, but only knock them unconscious for an hour before they awaken with 1 HP.

The caster may pick one special quality for the creature when it is summoned: the ability to fly at a rate of 30’/ move, the perfect duplication of a particular person they’ve seen, the ability to form a telepathic speech connection with the caster, or the ability to effectively use normal weaponry and armor.

The servitor lasts until destroyed or the dawn after the spell is cast.

#### Swapping Sigil
This spell is cast in two parts, each of which must be cast separately within a mile of each other, though such paired use counts as only a single spell slot.

The first casting inscribes a palm-sized seal of ruddy brown radiance on the ground beneath the caster. The second casting will immediately switch the caster and all creatures and objects within ten feet with all creatures and objects within ten feet of the sigil.

The caster may refrain from swapping certain targets as they wish. Only portable objects are swapped; any object too heavy for the caster to lift or secured in place remains unmoved. Unwilling targets get no saving throw if they have four or less HD; others can make a [Mental](/rules#mental) save. Unused sigils dissipate in a day.

### Level 5 - High Magic

#### Color Bomb
A blinding fan of impossible colors cascades over all targets in front of the caster in an area equal to a cone a hundred feet long and a hundred feet wide at the end.

Each creature within that area must make a [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw; those who fail roll `1d6`. On a 1, they are unharmed, on a 2 they collapse into a handful of dust, on a 3 they fall unconscious for an hour, on a 4 they go violently insane for the next hour and attack all around them, on a 5 they turn to stone, and on a 6 they become utterly enthralled to the caster’s commands for the next hour, as if under the effect of an [Dominate Person](#dominate-person) spell.

#### Gate
The caster carves open a metadimensional gate between their present location and a preset target point.

Attuning the target point requires an hour of effort, after which this spell will open an opaque portal to it from a distance of up to one hundred miles per caster level. The portal is large enough to admit a cart and wagon and will remain open for up to one minute per caster level, ending when they pass through it. The gate is one-way only, from caster to target.

Only living creatures and the vehicles they drive and objects they carry may pass through; atmosphere and other environments remain on the far side of the gate. Only one target point may be prepared for this spell at a time, and there is a 1-in-10 chance for every casting that the real destination is `1d100` miles in a random direction, discovered only after the portal is used.

#### Impenatrable Dome
The caster hurls up a magical shield that is impervious to almost all hostile powers.

Unlike most sorceries, this spell can be cast as an [Instant Action](/combat#instant-action), and immediately creates a transparent bubble of force around the caster with up to a twenty-foot radius.

Entities and forces outside the bubble cannot penetrate it, and the interior remains a warm, breathable, safe environment regardless of the exterior. Those within the bubble can pass out of it, but they cannot then return within. The bubble can be dispelled by appropriate magics, but other enchantments and attacks cannot harm it, nor can magical effects or material objects pass through it from either direction.

The spell lasts until the caster departs from the bubble.

#### Maze
Aimed at a visible point within three hundred feet, the spell affects all creatures except the caster within a ten-foot radius of the target, translating them into a lightless extradimensional maze of endlessly tall obsidian walls.

The maze is infinite, featureless, and empty. Transported creatures get a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to end the spell, re-appearing one round after it was cast. Those who fail their save get to make an additional attempt once an hour afterwards. Creatures with five or fewer HD cannot attempt these saving throws and are trapped forever unless the mage is killed or ends the spell.

Time passes normally while trapped, and creatures snared within may rest, fight, or starve. Dead or escaped creatures appear in the nearest clear space to their original departure.

#### Mold Landscape
The caster molds the soil and stone of the land around them, raising hills, digging trenches, or forming simple structures out of extruded bedrock.

Once cast, the mage psychically molds the terrain within three hundred feet per caster level, shifting it slowly over the course of an hour to form whatever shape they desire out of it, provided the material used can actually maintain such a shape.

Simple buildings and walls may be created out of bedrock or available stone, and tunnels and caves may be shaped up to 50 feet down from the caster, while hills may be raised up to 200 feet above the prevailing grade. This spell cannot work within a thousand feet of stone or earth that has been significantly worked by intelligent creatures, though the use of this spell by the same caster doesn’t count as working the earth on further castings.

#### Time Stop
The caster and up to one visible ally per caster level briefly step outside of the conventional flow of time, the rest of the world freezing around them.

These subjects can take `1d4+1` free rounds of actions, but they cannot physically affect the world or move any object they were not carrying at the time they cast the spell. Any spells the caster or other allies cast can affect only their own group, and not those entities still in the normal flow of time.

#### Typhoon
The caster unleashes a consuming destruction on a visible point within three thousand feet.

A torrent of eldritch ruin rains down from the heavens on everything within up to a two hundred foot radius per caster level, inflicting `1d8` damage per caster level with a [Physical](/rules#physical) save for half damage, and automatically killing all targets with 4 or fewer HD.

This damage is sufficient to destroy any wooden or lightly-built stone structure and will seriously damage even fortifications. The caster can tighten the radius down to a minimum of 20 feet, but cannot be selective about targets within that area.

This spell cannot be cast indoors, and is extremely hazardous to the caster; they must make a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw on casting it or suffer a quarter of the damage inflicted, rounded up.

## Elementalist Spells

### Level 1 - Elementalist

#### Elemental Spy
The elementalist enchants a stone, ounce of liquid, flame no smaller than a candleflame, or a particular plume of smoke or incense.

For one day per level, so long as the charmed object is not destroyed, dispersed, or consumed, they can as a [Main Action](/combat#main-action) see and listen to anything around the object as if they were standing there.

#### Flame Scrying
The elementalist becomes aware of the approximate locations of all open flames within thirty feet per caster level.

They choose one of those flames as a focus for the scrying, allowing them to see and hear everything around the flame as if they were present. The spell’s duration lasts for as long as the elementalist remains motionlessly focused on it; during this duration, they may switch their focus between the various flames in range as they wish.

#### One With Water
The elementalist and up to a dozen allies are enchanted with powers of water-breathing, a tolerance for the pressure and cold of the deeps, and the ability to see through water as if it were well-lit air.

Enchanted beings move freely while in the water at their usual movement rate and their attacks and projectile weapons are not hindered by the medium, nor are their possessions soaked or damaged. The spell lasts for one hour per caster level, but will not naturally end so long as a subject is still at least partially submerged. Only the caster or magical dispelling can stop it under those circumstances.

#### Shape Element
The elementalist makes a direct appeal to a non-magical mass of earth, stone, water, flame, or air no larger than a ten-foot cube.

At the end of the round, the mass will move or reshape itself within that space as the elementalist requests, maintaining its new form until the end of the [Turn](/rules#turn). If its new shape is one that is stable without magical help, it can be told to remain in it after the spell is finished.

### Level 2 - Elementalist

#### Continual Flame
A sample of flame no larger than the caster is made effectively eternal.

It no longer consumes the object it burns, though it can still be used to burn or heat other things, and it resists all extinguishing save being buried or wholly immersed in water. The elementalist can temporarily extinguish it at will.

A number of such flames can be created equal to the elementalist’s level; beyond that, special ingredients and fuels are needed that cost 500 silver pieces per flame. If used as a weapon, it adds +2 damage to a successful hit, albeit nothing to Shock.

The flame lasts until dispelled, extinguished, or the elementalist releases it.

#### Elemental Resistance
The elementalist chooses earth, water, fire, or wind when casting this spell and selects a visible target to be affected.

For the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn), the target is immune to injury caused by mundane manifestations of that substance; stone weapons don’t harm them, water doesn’t drown them, fire doesn’t burn them, and wind doesn’t topple them. This affects secondary effects of the material as well; a fire-pacted mage couldn’t be boiled in a pot, and an earth-pacted one won’t be suffocated if buried alive.

#### Fly
The elementalist chooses a visible ally within one hundred feet; the target becomes capable of swift and easy aerial travel, flying at twice their usual movement rate.

If the spell ends or is dispelled while aloft, the target descends gently to the earth. This spell lasts for one [Turn](/rules#turn), though casters of fifth level or more can make it last an hour, and those of eighth level or more can make it last until dawn or dusk, whichever comes next.

#### Form Tunnel
A passage is carved through natural stone or earth, forming a tunnel up to twenty feet long per caster level and up to ten feet wide and tall.

The caster ca cause the earth to compress and pack itself so as to stabilize the tunnel even in very sandy or burdened soil, or they can allow it to collapse naturally if burdened by some large structure or unstable surroundings.

This spell can function against worked stone, but the length of the tunnel is much shorter, being only two feet per level. Magical stone or earth cannot be altered by this spell. The caster has basic control over the direction and interior features of the tunnel, and can form stairs or other simple structures within it.

#### Become Element
The elementalist charges their physical shape with the qualities of a chosen element for the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn).

In all cases, they need not breathe and become immune to poisons and diseases not already present in them. If stone, they automatically stabilize at zero HP and ignore the first three points of damage from any source of harm. If water, they can pass through any aperture a mouse could get through. If air, they can fly at their usual movement rate and gain a +4 AC bonus against ranged attacks. If fire, they inflict `1d6` damage to all creatures in melee range at the start of their turn each round and become immune to heat damage.

### Level 3 - Elementalist

#### Elemental Wall
Conjure a a wall of a chosen churning elemental force.

The barrier is ten feet long per character level, with a height of ten feet and a thickness of one foot. The barrier must rest on solid ground but may be bent or shaped as desired so long as no part of it is more than two hundred feet from the caster.

Earthen walls are impervious to anything but mining-appropriate tools or rock-shattering strength, taking 20 HP of damage to knock a man-sized hole in them.

Fire walls inflict `3d6` damage plus the elementalist’s level on anyone who passes through them.

Water walls spin and hurl creatures of ox-size or less who pass through them, ejecting them at a random point on the far side of the wall and doing `2d6` damage from the buffeting.

Air walls are invisible, inaudible, and twenty feet in height; those who cross them suffer `1d6` plus the elementalist’s level in electrical damage.

The walls vanish at the end of the [Turn](/rules#turn).

#### Gaseous Form
A visible target creature and their possessions are briefly transformed into a misty, insubstantial cloud.

Only sources of harm that could conceivably disrupt a cloud of mist can harm them, and until the spell’s end they may pass freely into any area that a vapor could reach. They move freely in all three dimensions at their normal movement rate, though they cannot physically manipulate objects.

The spell lasts until the end of the [Turn](/rules#turn) or until the target or the caster choose to end it.

### Level 4 - Elementalist

#### Calcify
A visible target within one hundred feet must make a [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw or be turned to stone.

Any size of living creature may be so transmuted, though inanimate objects larger than a cart cannot. Objects being held or worn by someone else get a [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw made by their user. The calcification remains until dispelled or the caster undoes the magic, but if the object or creature is damaged in the meanwhile, it may end up being harmed or killed on its restoration.

If the [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw is made successfully by a creature, the target is temporarily slowed, losing its [Move Action](/combat#move-action) for the next `1d6` rounds.

#### Elemental Guardian
The elementalist imbues a human-sized mass of earth, water, fire, or air with a crude awareness and an eagerness to defend them.

Whatever the substance used, it now has 4 HD, AC 15, a Move of 40’/action, a +1 skill bonus, saves of 13+, and a melee attack of +6/`1d10` with no Shock. If called from earth, it has 6 HD, albeit its other stats don’t change. If called from fire, it does 5/- Shock damage.

If summoned from water, it has an AC of 18, and if called from air, it can fly at its usual movement rate. It has a human degree of intelligence, can communicate with others and manipulate objects, and serves with suicidal devotion.

Only one elemental guardian can be summoned at any one time, and if destroyed, a new one cannot be called that same round.

A guardian persists until destroyed or until the dawn after they have been summoned.

### Level 5 - Elementalist

#### Earthquake
The elementalist calls up a deep, rolling tremor from within the earth, centering it on a visible point and affecting all structures in a radius of up to five hundred feet.

This spell’s effects build slowly, requiring five minutes to fully manifest, but they can successfully topple or destroy any structures, tunnels, or caves within the affected area unless such structures are magically reinforced.

The effects are negated if the spell is dispelled within a minute after it was cast; after that, it’s too late to stop the effect.

#### Fury of the Elements
A combination of molten rock, searing pyroclastic winds, and super-heated steam erupts forth to ravage a chosen target point within two hundred feet per caster level.

The cataclysmic ruin smites everything within thirty feet of the target point for `10d6` damage, destroying all conventional structures. The zone of devastation then moves `1d6x10` feet in a random direction at the start of the next round, blasting everything in its path. The zone will continue to wander in this fashion for `1d6` rounds in total before dying out.

The molten remnants of the spell remain after this duration, a hazard for whomever enters the area for the rest of the day.

## Necromancer Spells

### Level 1 - Necromantic

#### Command the Dead
The necromancer exerts their will over a number of HD worth of undead equal to twice their character level.

These undead must be visible and within one hundred feet of the caster. Undead get a [Mental](/rules#mental) saving throw to resist this binding, at a penalty equal to the caster’s [Magic](/rules#magic). Creatures only partially-bewitched by the spell due to their excess HD merely stand dazed for a round. Those fully within the HD cap who are affected become suicidally loyal to the necromancer until they are released by the caster.

Regardless of how often the caster uses this spell, they may have no more than twice their level worth of HD bound at any one time, with the oldest-enchanted being first released.

#### Disguise Death
A necromancer gives an undead creature the semblance of a healthy, normal living being with this spell.

The target appears as it did in life, at any point in its lifespan that the necromancer so desires, and is capable of performing all normal human activities that its cognition allows it to perform. The spell uses the creature’s nature as a template for its effects, so the disguise is tangible and physically real until dispelled or the necromancer drops the effect.

A necromancer can maintain only one such disguise per level, and it does not work on sentient unwilling targets.

#### Smite the Dead
The necromancer conjures a blast of dispelling force at a point within one hundred feet per caster level, affecting an area up to 20 feet in radius.

All hostile undead within that area immediately suffer `1d10` damage per caster level. Undead with HD equal or less than the caster’s level must make a [Physical](/rules#physical) save or be destroyed outright.

The necromancer may [Commit Effort](/arcane-traditions#committing-effort) for the day immediately before casting this spell; if so, its casting does not count against the Necromancer’s available spell slots for the day.

#### Speak with Corpse
This spell requires a corpse with largely-intact organs of communication.

The corpse cannot have been dead for more than one day per caster level. Once sorceled, the corpse will answer up to one question per caster level, with the caster understanding the answers regardless of the creature’s natural language. Corpses are laconic, and generally answer in no more than one or two sentences; their replies will be truthful, but tend to be literal and they have no power to hypothesize or make judgments.

This spell may not be used twice on the same corpse.

### Level 2 - Necromantic

#### Augment Vitality
The necromancer refines and enhances the natural flow of vitality within a willing visible target.

For the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn), all [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throws they make gain a bonus equal to the necromancer’s [Magic](/rules#magic) and they automatically stabilize when [Mortally Injured](/rules#mortal-injury-and-stabalization). Once during the [Turn](/rules#turn), as an [Instant Action](/combat#instant-actin)o, they immediately heal from all damage inflicted by an injury that did not Mortally Wound them.

The recipient of this spell gains one [System Strain](/rules#system-strain).

#### Enfeebling Wave
A wash of debilitating force erupts in a 20-foot radius at a visible point within one hundred feet.

All living creatures within the area must make a [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw or for the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn) their movement rate is halved and they must make all attack and damage rolls twice and take the worse result. If the save is successful, these penalties apply only to the next [Round](/rules#round).

#### Final Death
The necromancer curses one visible target per level.

For the rest of the [Turn](/rules#turn), these targets cannot recover or gain HP and will die instantly if Mortally Injured. After each failed instance of healing, a target makes a [Physical](/rules#physical) save to throw off the spell.

#### Raise Corpse
The necromancer targets a mostly-intact skeleton or corpse, imbuing it with a semblance of life.

Whatever the creature’s attributes were in life, it now has 1 HD, an AC of 13, a Move of 30’/round, a +0 skill bonus, saves of 15+, and a +1/`1d6` unarmed melee attack. Such corpses may be equipped with weapons or armor. Its decay or dissolution immediately ceases, and it becomes suicidally loyal to its creator. The corpse has no natural volition, but will obey commands with a human degree of intelligence. It has only vague memories of its prior life, and while it retains human tics or habits it had in life it can answer only the simplest and most self-evident questions.

Damage to a corpse can be repaired only by casting this spell on it again, which restores it to its original “health”. The corpse continues to exist until it is reduced to zero HP or its creator releases it.

A necromancer cannot have more active subjects of this spell than their character level.

### Level 3 - Necromantic

#### Dominate Flesh
A visible living creature or physically-bodied undead within 100 feet is ensorceled by this spell, their flesh and bones becoming temporarily enthralled to the caster’s will.

The target becomes paralyzed unless commanded by the caster as a [Free Action](/combat#free-action); once given a command, their body will dutifully carry it out on their next [Turn](/rules#turn). The user’s mind is not affected by this spell, so they cannot be made to cast spells, answer questions, or perform other intellectual tasks, but they will fight, move, and perform other non-suicidal physical acts as normal. The target may make a [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw at the start of each [Round](/rules#round) to throw off the effect, but they will inevitably suffer one point of damage per caster level with each attempt as their flesh writhes and tears.

If not thrown off earlier, the spell lasts until the end of the [Turn](/rules#turn).

#### Festering Curse
The qualities of a corpse are forced upon a visible living target.

The subject begins to rot, fester, and decay in whatever ways the necromancer thinks appropriate. Food tastes like ashes, water does not quench thirst, and their body is numb to all physical pleasures. They suffer a -2 penalty to all social skill checks due to their repugnance. This transformation does not inflict physical injury, but it makes the target’s life an utterly joyless misery until it is dispelled or the necromancer lifts the curse.

Creatures with more HD than the necromancer has levels can make a [Physical](/rules#physical) save to resist the curse.

#### Forgetting the Grave
Temporarily suspend the mortality of a willing target within sight.

For one round per Necromancer level, the creature simply cannot die, no matter how drastic their injuries. Those reduced to zero HP lose their [Move Action](/combat#move-action) each [Round](/rules#round) but can continue to act otherwise; if such a target is damaged yet again, they must make a [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw each time or become incapable of movement until healed.

At the spell’s end targets reduced to zero HP are Mortally Injured; those that have been dismembered or otherwise slaughtered beyond the hope of survival die instantly.

#### Share Vitality
By molding the plasmic stuff of life force, create a bond between two willing or helpless targets.

These subjects must be close enough for the necromancer to touch; thereafter, for as long as the spell is in effect, the two creatures pool their HP. Injuries to either subtract from this pool, and neither dies until it is reduced to zero, whereupon both are [Mortally Injured](/rules#mortal-injury-and-stabalization). They can communicate telepathically at will while the spell is in effect.

The power ends at daybreak; if dispelled sooner, the remaining pool is split proportionately.

### Level 4 - Necromantic

#### Boneshape
The clay of flesh and bone run obediently to the will of the necromancer.

Whether living or undead, a willing or helpless victim under the effects of this spell can be reshaped into any roughly-equivalent form with an hour’s work. Limbs can be added or removed and existing tissue can be recolored, re-textured, or rearranged to the necromancer’s wishes. Perfect imitation of a particular creature requires a DC 10 DEX/[Magic](/rules#magic) check. This spell is limited in the physical changes it can effect; a bonus of +1 can be added to a physical attribute at the cost of a -1 penalty to a different physical attribute, to a maximum of +2 or -2.

This spell lasts until the necromancer lifts it or it is dispelled.

#### Raise Grave Knight
The corpse used for this spell must be of a relatively powerful creature with at least 4 HD or levels.

The result is much like that of the Raise Corpse spell, but this undead servitor is much stronger, with 4 HD, AC 15, a Move of 40’/action, a +1 skill bonus, saves of 13+, and a melee attack of +6/`1d10`, assuming it doesn’t use a normal weapon. It is fully intelligent and self-willed, albeit utterly devoted to its creator, and it remembers a significant amount about its prior life. A grave knight regains all lost HP at dusk each day, assuming it’s not destroyed. A caster may have only one grave knight active at a time.

One that has been reduced to zero HP is destroyed and can only be rebuilt with a month of painstaking repair and re-enchantment.

### Level 5 - Necromantic

#### Call of the Tomb
The necromancer invokes the inescapable urge for self-dissolution within the substance of all that exists, amplifying the weight of their own mortality.

All enemy creatures within forty feet are affected. Targets make a [Physical](/rules#physical) saving throw to resist, in which case the effects last only one round, otherwise lasting for one round per caster level. During this time all attacks made against the victims automatically hit and all damage dice they suffer are maximized. Any special defenses they may have against mundane weapons or certain types of injury are negated while the spell is on them.

#### Everlasting
The spell may be triggered as an [Instant Action](/combat#instant-action) by the caster, imparting a burst of unquenchable life force to all allied creatures within 50 feet.

For the next five rounds, no affected ally can be reduced below 1 HP, regardless of the damage inflicted upon them. At the end of the spell’s effect, the caster’s own life energy is exhausted, leaving them with only 1 HP.

A creature can benefit from this spell no more than once per day.
