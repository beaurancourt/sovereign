Welcome to Sovereign!

This game endeavors to provide a ruleset that allows players to play through modules compatible with [1980s D&D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_Basic_Set). Little conversion should be necessary. The game hopes to be written more clearly, be more searchable, better hyperlinked, have more depth, and boast a better in-game economy.

This document is split in several sections.

If you prefer to learn by example and with exercises, the Tutorial (not available yet) has you covered.

[Delver Creation](/delver-creation) will walk you through the process of creating a character.

If you're looking up a rule, or prefer to learn more traditionally:

- [Rules](/rules) goes over the character stats, delving, hazards, and recovery rules.
- [Feats](/feats) details all of the feats available to a Delver.
- [Combat](/combat) explains all things relating to fighting.
- [Equipment](/equipment) lists weapons, armors, goods and services available for purchase.
- [Spells](/spells) indexes all known spells, categorized by tradition and level.

A Bestiary, Magic Item repository, and extensive GM section are in progress. In the mean time, check out [those outside the walls](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/422653/Those-Outside-the-Walls--A-450-Monster-Bestiary) and [basic fantasy](https://basicfantasy.org/srd/monstersAll.html) for monsters, and [basic fantasy](https://www.basicfantasy.org/srd/magicItems.html) for magic items.

### The Module Stack

- Anything rated ["Best" at tenfootpole](https://tenfootpole.org/ironspike/?cat=7).
- Anything Melan rates a `**** / *****` or higher. I don't know of a good way to filter here, but [here are all of the reviews](https://beyondfomalhaut.blogspot.com/search/label/review)
- Anything prince rates a `*****` or higher on [his review list](https://princeofnothingblogs.wordpress.com/reviews/)

### Change Log

#### 2024-07-24
- Add a tutorial for learning delver creation. Still need a worked example.
- Keep items on card stock
- Add rules for doors. So many doors.
- Drop a ton of instances of 'may' and 'can' that weren't actual choices.
- Use "HP" instead of "hit points".
- Add paragraphs to the spell descriptions.
- Use those outside the walls and basic fantasy as stop-gaps.
- Add a narrative interaction section.
- Add morale.
- Add a core game loop section.
- Standardize on 'attack bonus' - it was sometimes called 'base attack bonus'.

#### 2024-07-23
- Use population sizes instead of ACKS's market classes for equipment availability.
- Use "feat" instead of "focus".
- Use "Free Action" instead of "On Turn Action" to free up the "Turn" word.
- Use "Turn" instead of "Scene", consolidating those keywords.
- Simplify the spell names to be more D&D-familiar. The WWN names are [antimemetic](https://qntm.org/scp).
- Use the ACKs prices for equipment instead of the WWN prices
- Remove the luck saving throw; we just don't need it.
- Remove WWN backgrounds, simplify to just making 4 total improvements.
- Remove Administer, Connect, Convince, Craft, Perform, Sail, Survive, Trade, and Work as skills. They're inappropriate for this style of play.
- Remove the feats associated with those skills.
- Remove the Bard, Beastmaster, Blood priest, Invoker, Mage Slayer, Skinshifter, Thought noble, Vowed, and Wise classes. The class list was bloated and each niche we carve out makes each other class less flexible. This also makes it so that there are no warrior or expert sub-classes, which simplifies the language.
- Simplify the skill levels. There was an implied -1 level before (untrained) that gave an extra -1 for specifically attack rolls. Remove that exception and start all skills at level -1.
- Standardize language around attribute modifiers. Rather than saying "Strength modifier", we just say "STR".
- Remove starting packages. Just buy gear!
- Standardize group checks and aiding skill checks into the same thing.
- Rewrite opposed checks so that only one side is rolling. This saves time at the table and is probabilistically equivalent.
- Remove *tons* of weasel words.
- Resolve "optional" rules, either making them non-optional or removing them.
- Standardize on "mortal injury" - it was sometimes getting called "mortal wound".
- Remove everything about mounted combat, just isn't an exception worth exploring.
- Simplify chases.
- Replace WWN's XP system with a slightly-more-generous version of BX's.
- Rip out all of the downtime stuff; it's out of scope. No crafting, no modifying.
- Remove all of the wilderness exploration stuff. It's [not worth it](https://rancourt.substack.com/i/146342934/conclusions-and-suggestions). We want to spend time in dungeons playing modules.

### Attributions

Sovereign is built on a (much reduced) chassis of [Worlds Without Number](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348791/Worlds-Without-Number); taking its feat system, classes, spells, and combat. We sprinkle in [ACKs 2e](https://autarch.co/adventurer-conqueror-king/)'s top-notch economy. The bestiary is built off of [Those Outside the Walls](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/422653/Those-Outside-the-Walls--A-450-Monster-Bestiary), and many of the spell name changes are from [this community spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JVoO0kBs4OWH8sfQW0als0akRoeDFEdZejW4TF6x92w/edit?gid=0#gid=0).
