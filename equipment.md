# Equipment

## Coins and Money

Purchases are made using coins. A copper piece (c) purchases a loaf of bread or three pints of cheap ale. 10c make a silver piece (s). 10s or 100c make a gold piece (g).

Uncommon are electrum pieces (e) worth 5s, and platinum pieces (p) worth 5g.

The monthly standard of living for various members of society are provided to get a better grasp on the value of gold:

| Profession                                  | Monthly Income/Expenses |
| ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Skilled labor                               | 3-12g                   |
| Journeyman craftsmen, 1st level Delvers     | 12-40g                  |
| Master craftsmen, 2nd level Delvers         | 40-100g                 |
| Master professionals, 3rd-4th level Delvers | 100-450g                |
| Barons, 5th-7th level Delvers               | 450-2,000g              |
| Counts, 8th-9th level Delvers               | 2,000-12,000g           |
| Dukes, 10th level Delvers                   | 12,000-80,000g          |
| Kings                                       | 80,000+g                |

Income and expenses are roughly equal in most cases. Net worth (often in the form of land and equipment and whatnot) is ~33x monthly income/expenses. Coinage tends to make up about 5% of a NPC's net worth.

So, a Baron with a 1000g/mo income also has ~1000g/mo in expenses. They're worth 33,000g (mostly in land, structures, etc), and have 1650g on hand.

## Equipment Availability

Markets are not able to supply infinite amounts of goods. The monthly availability goods by the population of a market are given below.

| Price / Pop     | 100k+ | 25k+ | 10k+ | 3k+ | 1k+ | 999- |
| --------------- | ----- | ---- | ---- | --- | --- | ---- |
| 1g or less      | 2,750 | 700  | 425  | 100 | 35  | 15   |
| 2g–10g          | 300   | 70   | 35   | 10  | 3   | 1    |
| 11–100g         | 20    | 5    | 2    | 1   | 25% | 10%  |
| 101–1,000g      | 7     | 2    | 1    | 25% | 10% | 5%   |
| 1,001–10,000g   | 2     | 1    | 25%  | 10% | 5%  | 1%   |
| 10,001g or more | 25%   | 10%  | 3%   | 1%  | NA  | NA   |

If the entry contains a percentage, treat that as the chance that one such item exists.

Goods that are meaningfully different from each other are counted separately, thus a 1500-population town can sell the party 3 short swords (7g each) *and* 3 Battle Axes (7g each) per month.

This chart represents the party's ability to both buy *and sell* in a market, so a party has a 5% monthly chance to be able to sell a 750g emerald in a village with a population of 400.

- **2H**: Two Handed. The weapon requires two hands to use in combat. Ranged two-handed weapons cannot be fired effectively while an enemy is within melee range.
- **AP**: Armor Piercing. This weapon ignores non-magical hides, armor and shields for purposes of its hit rolls.
- **FX**: Fixed. The weapon is too heavy and clumsy to use without a fixed position and at least five minutes to entrench it.
- **L**: Long. The weapon is unusually long, allowing melee attacks to be made at targets up to 10 feet distant, even if an ally is in the way. Even so, the wielder still needs to be within five feet of a foe to count as being in melee with them for purposes of forcing Fighting With- drawals, disrupting large ranged weapons, or similar maneuvers.
- **LL**: Less Lethal. Foes brought to zero hit points by this weapon can always be left alive at the wielder’s discretion.
- **N**: Numerous. Five of these count as only one Readied item.
- **PM**: Precisely Murderous. When used for an Execution Attack, the weapon applies an additional -1 penalty to the Physical save and does double damage even if it succeeds.
- **R**: Reload. The weapon takes a Move action to reload. If the user has at least Shoot-1 skill, they can reload as an On Turn action instead.
- **S**: Subtle. Can be easily hidden in clothing or jewelry.
- **SR**: Slow Reload. It takes a Main Action to reload this weapon. SS: Single Shot. This weapon takes ten rounds to reload, and the reloading effort is spoiled if an enemy melees the wielder.
- **T**: Throwable. While the weapon can be used in melee, it may be thrown out to the listed range as well, albeit it does no Shock in that case. Throwing a weapon while in melee applies a -4 penalty to the hit roll.

## Services

To pay a professional for a few hours of their time, divide their monthly wage by 40. For a day, divide their monthly wage by 20. For a month or more, pay for however many months you keep them on retainer.

For example, paying a guard to watch your rooms for 7 days might cost `10g (monthly wage for skilled labor) / 20 (for a day) * 7 (days) = 4g`.

Bribes to overlook a minor crime cost a day's worth of the witness' time. To overlook a major crime, a month. To overlook a capital crime, a year.

Curing Diseases costs 500g, lifting curses or undoing magic costs 1000g. These kinds of curatives are subject to Equipment Availability for the market.
