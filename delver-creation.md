# Delver Creation

## Attributes

A Delver has six attributes ranging from 3 to 18, reflecting a range from
the minimum viable capacity for a playable character to the maximum normal
human level.

Three of these attributes are physical.

**Strength**, reflecting physical prowess, melee combat, carrying gear, and brute force.

**Dexterity**, reflecting speed, evasion, manual dexterity, reaction time, and combat initiative.

**Constitution**, reflecting hardiness, enduring injury, and tolerating large amounts of magical healing.

Three are mental attributes.

**Intelligence**, reflecting memory, reasoning, technical skills, and general education.

**Wisdom**, reflecting noticing things, making judgments, reading situations, and intuition.

**Charisma**, reflecting commanding, charming, attracting attention, and being taken seriously.

### Generating Attributes

To generate their six attributes, roll 3d6 in order, once for each attribute. At any point character creation you may substitute a score of 14 for one rolled score.

## Attribute Modifiers

Each attribute has a modifier, usually ranging from -2 to +2. This modifier is added to skill checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, Shock damage, and the relevant saving throw targets.

An attribute score of 3 has a modifier of -2. A score of 4-7 has a modifier of -1. A score of 8-13 has a modifier of +0. A score of 14-17 has a modifier of +1. A score of 18 has a modifier of +2.

Some Feats and abilities may add bonuses or penalties to an attribute’s base modifier. Such bonuses or penalties cannot increase the modifier above +2 or below -2. If an injury or character advancements alters an attribute, update the attribute’s modifier.

## Skills

A Delver’s skills reprsent their training. A newly-created Delver starts with a few trained skills and may gain more as the Delver advances in level.

### Interpretting Skill Levels

Skills are rated on a scale between untrained and level 4. Untrained (marked as `-` on a character sheet) represents an absence of training. Level 0 represents basic competence. Level 1 represents professional-level skill. Level 2 in a skill likely makes a character the best in a village or city block. Level 3 represents mastery, and likely makes the character one of the best in a city. Level 4 represents world-class skill.

### The Skill List

Skills may overlap in their application; the character may use either skill at their discretion.

- **Exert**: Run, swim, climb, jump, labor for long periods, throw things, or otherwise exert your physical strength, stamina, and coordination. Even a PC with poor physical attributes might have a good Exert skill reflecting athletic training and expertise in making the most of their available talents.
- **Heal**: Treat wounds, cure diseases, neutralize poisons, diagnose psychological health issues, and otherwise tend to the wounds of body and mind. - **Know**: Know matters of history, geography, natural science, zoology, and other academic fields appropriate to a sage or scholar. While some sages might specialize in particular fields, most learned folks have a broad range of understanding, and will rarely be unable to even attempt to answer a question relevant to this skill.
- **Lead**: Inspire others to follow your lead and believe in your plans and goals. Manage subordinates and keep them focused, loyal, and motivated in the face of danger or failure. A successful leader will keep their subordinate’s faith and confidence even when reason might make the leader’s plan appear questionable at best.
- **Magic**: Cast or analyze magic and know things about famous mages or notable magical events. Classes that can’t cast spells obtain only intellectual and scholarly benefits from this skill.
- **Notice**: Notice small details, impending ambushes, hidden features, or concealed objects. Detect subtle smells, sounds, or other sensory input.
- **Punch**: Fight unarmed or with natural body weaponry. Punch, kick, grapple, or otherwise brawl without the benefit of man-made tools. This mode of fighting is inefficient at best without a Feat to improve it, but it’s reliably non-lethal.
- **Shoot**: Fire a bow or crossbow or throw a hurled weapon. Maintain ranged weaponry and fletch arrows.
- **Sneak**: Move silently, hide in shadows, avoid notice, pick pockets, disguise yourself, pick locks, defeat traps, or otherwise overcome security measures.
- **Stab**: Fight with melee weapons or throw a hurled weapon. Maintain and identify weaponry.

## Starting Improvements

A newly-created Delver may make 4 total improvements to their Skills or Attributes. To improve an Attribute, raise it by 1 to a maximum of 18 and then recalculate its Modifier. To improve a Skill, raise its level by 1 to a maximum of 1.

A single Attribute or Skill can be improved multiple times.

## Core Competencies

Adventuring is a profession, and all Delvers have undergone extensive training to become 1st level. They can clean and sharpen weapons, set up camp, cook meals, ride mounts, perform first aid, know the value of coins, trade goods, treasure, and identify common magical effects and monsters.

## Classes

Delving is done in a party of specialists. A class represents the particular skills, abilities, or talents that make the Delver valuable to the party.

The three base classes are Expert, Mage, and Warrior. Each of these base classes has its own hit die, attack progression, and Feat advancement.

### Full and Partial Classes

There are two kinds of classes: full classes and Partial classes. You may choose a single class, committing completely to that class’ profession. Alternatively, you may pick two Partial classes, mixing their abilities.

### Effort

Mages have special abilities that are fueled with magical power, inner focus, or some other reserve of energy. This is measured in points of Effort, a resource the Delver can commit to activate their abilities.

Every class that uses Effort has its own unique pool: High Mage Effort, Vowed Effort, Healer Effort, etc. Delvers with two Partial classes that use Effort have two separately-tracked pools, one for each class. Points of Effort from one class cannot be used to fuel powers from another.

#### Committing Effort

Most class powers require that Effort be Committed. Committing Effort is done as part of activating a power, and ties up the Effort for a varying amount of time depending on the ability used.

Some powers **Commit Effort for the duration**. This means the Effort remains Committed as long as the power is active. The PC can reclaim the Committed Effort at any time as an Instant action, deactivating the power.

Some powers **Commit Effort for the scene**. The Effort remains Committed until the end of the scene, after which it returns to the PC. It cannot be reclaimed earlier, even if the ability it fuels is only good for a single attack or action. A scene usually amounts to a single fight, event, or dungeon turn, almost never lasting more than fifteen minutes. Further specifics are provided in the time section of the game rules.

Some powers **Commit Effort for the day**. Once Committed, this Effort can be recovered only after a comfortable night’s rest. If the PC is hungry, cold, sick, or sleeping without the benefits of a bedroll or other basic comforts, this Effort cannot be recovered.

Activating a power only ever requires Committing a single point of Effort unless the power itself says otherwise.

## The Class List

### Expert

Experts gain the widest variety of non-combat skills and are the quickest to learn more of them.

| Level | Hit Dice | Attack Bonus | Focus Picks           |
|-------|----------|--------------|-----------------------|
| 1     | 1d6      | +0           | 1 Expert + 1 Any      |
| 2     | 2d6      | +1           | +1 Any                |

| 5     | 5d6      | +2           | +1 Any                |

| 10    | 10d6     | +5           | +1 Any                |

#### Class Ability: Masterful Expertise

Once per turn, a Expert may reroll any non-combat skill check as an Instant action. This allows the Expert to make a roll and then immediately use this ability if the resulting total isn’t good enough to succeed. In cases where it matters, the better of the two rolls may be used.

Note that the typical ten-minute dungeon exploration turn generally counts as a scene, allowing the Full Expert to use this ability every turn if they so wish.

Partial Experts **do not** receive this ability.

#### Class Ability: Quick Learner

When you advance a character level, you gain an extra skill point which may only be spent on gaining or improving non-combat skills or raising attributes. You may save this point to spend later if you wish.

Partial Experts **do** receive this ability.

### Partial Expert

A Partial Expert is treated just as a full Expert, including gaining the benefits of the Quick Learner ability. They do not have the Masterful Expertise ability, however, as they lack the versatility of a full Expert.

## Mage

The Mage class is a general header under which all Delvers with fundamentally supernatural powers or spellcasting ability are placed. Choose a specific Arcane Tradition to follow - High Mage, Vowed, Elementalist, etc.

### Partial Mage

A Partial Mage is treated as a Mage, and picks an Arcane Tradition for their powers. That tradition’s abilities will be more limited for Partial Mages, however, as described under each of the paths.

You may pick the Partial Mage class twice for two different magical traditions. In this case, use the following table instead of the one listed in the partial class.

### Class Ability: Killing Blow

Whenever a Warrior inflicts damage with any attack, spell, or special ability they may add half their character level, rounded up, to the damage done. This damage is also added to any Shock they may inflict.

Combined with Foci meant to improve Shock attacks such as Armsmaster, Close Combatant, or Shocking Assault, this ability ensures that an experienced Warrior will almost always kill any ordinary human soldier or minor monster, regardless of their attack roll result.

Partial Warriors **do not** get this ability.

### Class Ability: Veteran’s Luck

Once per scene, as an Instant action, the Warrior may turn a missed attack they have made into a hit. Alternately, they may turn a successful attack against them into a miss, also as an Instant action. This ability is particularly lethal when used with the Make a Snap Attack action against weaker monsters, ordinary human warriors, and spell casters.

Partial Warriors **do not** get this ability.

### Partial Warrior

A Partial Warrior gains certain of the benefits of a full Warrior, including the improved hit die and a somewhat improved attack bonus. They do not have the Veteran’s Luck special ability or the Killing Blow power, however, and must trust to their own talents to land blows and crush their enemies.

## Arcane Traditions

### Accursed

The Accursed are Partial Mages that have made pacts with otherworldly beings, intentionally or otherwise, and gained powers from that bond.

All Accursed gain Magic-0 during character creation. Even those who are not spellcasters must understand the ways of eldritch beings and the subtleties of sorcery.

While the arts of Accursed Blade and Accursed Bolt use Magic as their combat skill, Foci that normally apply to mundane weapons such as Armsmaster or Deadeye also benefit their relevant melee or ranged attacks. For these Foci, use “Magic” in place of “Shoot” or “Stab” when gaining their benefits, including the granted skill and the stacking damage bonus that the first level of the Focus may grant.

#### Accursed Arts

An Accursed has an Effort score equal to their Magic skill level plus their Intelligence or Charisma modifier, to a minimum of one point. Every Accursed gains either Accursed Bolt or Accursed Blade as a starting art, plus one more of their choice. Accursed arts may be used in or out of armor.

- **Accursed Blade:** As an On Turn action, manifest an occult melee weapon as a one-handed 1d8 weapon or a two-handed 2d6 weapon. Both add your Magic skill to the damage roll, have a Shock rating of 2/15, and use Magic as the attack skill and the best of Str, Dex, Int, or Cha as its modifying attribute.
- **Accursed Bolt:** As Accursed Blade, but you launch blasts of occult force instead of meleeing. Their damage is 1d8 plus your Magic skill, their range is 200’, and the bolts can be thrown in melee at a -4 penalty to hit. These bolts need both hands free to hurl them.
- **Bewitching Distraction:** Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action when talking to an intelligent target when not in combat. They must make a Mental save or become dazed, oblivious to their surroundings and forgetting you and all else that happened in that scene. Danger ends the daze but not the forgetting.
- **Compelling Shriek:** Once per scene, Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and shout a command of no more than seven words. Chosen targets who hear and understand must make a Mental save or perform that action for one round, provided it is not totally contrary to their character.
- **Devil’s Bargain:** As a Main Action, consecrate a deal you’ve made with an uncoerced person. If they violate the deal or its spirit, you know instantly and may inflict 1d6 damage per level on them if desired.
- **Dire Pact:** Foes suffer a penalty equal to your Magic skill on all saves versus your Accursed arts. If they succeed, however, you gain one System Strain.
- **Lying Face:** Commit Effort as a Main Action; while it remains Committed, you can disguise yourself as any humanoid of the same general size, including clothing, scent, and voice.
- **Night-Black Eyes:** You can see clearly in perfect darkness. As a Main Action, focus on a particular visible object, person, or location; you can tell if it is enchanted, though no details about the magic are seen.
- **Pacted Protection:** Choose a type of harmful energy: fire, frost, acid, electricity, or the like. You become immune to natural degrees of this energy and take half damage from magical attacks involving it.
- **Rob Vitality:** Once per scene, as an On Turn action, Commit Effort for the scene and target a visible foe. They must make a Physical save or lose their next Main Action, which you immediately gain instead.
- **Scourging Curse:** Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action and target a visible foe. Your curse inflicts a -1 penalty to their hit, damage, and saving throw rolls for one round per level. At 4th level this penalty becomes -2, and at 9th it becomes -3. Only one such curse can be active at a given time.
- **Shadowed Steps:** As a Move Action, Commit Effort for the scene and teleport up to your Move distance. You cannot bypass walls or physical obstacles, but you can teleport vertically or into high places.
- **Snaring Speech:** Once per round as an Instant action, Commit Effort for the day when failing a skill check to persuade or tempt someone. They must make a Mental save or agree with your proposal if it’s something they would normally consider doing. Gain one System Strain when using this art.
- **Sorcerous Battery:** Once per day, as an On Turn action, Commit Effort for the day. You or a visible ally refresh the spell slot of a spell that has been cast since the start of the prior round. Gain one System Strain.
- **Soul Consumption:** As an Instant action, Commit Effort for the day when you fell an intelligent target with Accursed Bolt or Accursed Blade. They die instantly. You heal 1d6 hit points plus your level and lose one accumulated System Strain.
- **Tendrils of Night:** Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While Committed, you exude numerous tentacles or eldritch arms that can manipulate objects with your strength up to 20’ away. You gain no bonus actions, but the arms can melee at range. These arms have your AC, and you are damaged if they are hurt.
- **Unseen Steps:** As an On Turn action, Commit Effort for the day to turn invisible for 1d6 rounds plus your level. This invisibility breaks before you attack, cast spells, or perform other vigorous or violent actions.
- **Weight of Sin:** As a Main Action, Commit Effort for the day and target a visible foe. They must make a Physical save or lose their Move action for 1d6 rounds plus your level.
- **Weeping Wounds:** Once per round, Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action when a visible enemy takes damage. They must make a Physical save or suffer 1d6 damage per round for one round per level. They cannot heal or regenerate any hit point damage during this effect. This art does not stack.

### Duelist

The Duelist is a Partial Mage that uses arcane forces to enhance their speed and agility.

Duelists gain Stab as a bonus skill. No Duelist worth the name is entirely incapable of effective use of melee weapons, though the style lends itself heavily to specialization.

#### The Flaw of Fragility

While the canons of the duelist make for an excellent one-on-one combatant, their practitioners spend much less time at raw physical conditioning than their more traditional Warrior peers. The techniques they use are swift and lethal, but they aren’t as generally applicable to enduring harm as are standard training methods.

As such, Partial Warriors/Partial Duelists use 1d6 for their hit dice, rather than the Partial Warrior’s usual 1d6+2. Other partial class mixes are unaffected by this flaw.

#### Duelist Arts

Duelist Effort is equal to their Stab skill plus the highest of their Dexterity or Intelligence modifiers, to a minimum of one point. All Duelists begin with the Favored Weapon art and one more of their choice. Additional arts are learned as the PC advances in experience.

The arts of the Duelist require agility and free motion. The Duelist cannot benefit from any art of this class while wearing medium or heavy armor or carrying a large shield. Dual-wielding is practiced by some Duelists, but most prefer the defensive advantages of a small offhand shield.

Duelist arts do not apply to thrown weapons.

| Level | Favored Weapon Bonus | Arts Gained                |
| ----- | -------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 1     | +1                   | Favored Weapon and Any One |
| 2     | +1                   | Any One                    |
| 3     | +2                   |                            |
| 4     | +2                   | Any One                    |
| 5     | +3                   | Any One                    |
| 6     | +3                   | Any One                    |
| 7     | +4                   |                            |
| 8     | +4                   | Any One                    |
| 9     | +5                   |                            |
| 10    | +5                   | Any One                    |

- **Favored Weapon:** Choose one specific type of melee weapon. When using this type you may use the Favored Weapon attack bonus column on the above table to determine your base hit bonus, unless it’s already better for some other reason. If your second partial class is Partial Warrior, your class’ base hit bonus with the weapon is instead equal to your level.
- **Blood for Blood:** Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action when an enemy hits you with a physical attack. If you attack that enemy with your favored weapon before the end of the next round, the first blow hits automatically and can do no less damage than was done to you, up to the weapon’s maximum.
- **Burst of Speed:** Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action. You may move your full normal movement rate as an On Turn action. This art can be used only once per round.
- **Code Duello:** Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action when engaging with a single foe. So long as no other combatant attacks either your target or you, and you attack no one but your target, you gain a +4 bonus to your Armor Class and can roll your hit rolls twice, taking the better result. Once the Code Duello has been disrupted or ended, it cannot be invoked again during that scene.
- **Crushing Superiority:** Your favored weapon gains the Less Lethal quality if it doesn’t already have it. Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action when you hit a target; they must immediately make an Instant check. This ability can be used only once per scene on any given target.
- **Dauntless Step:** Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action. The Move actions you make for the rest of the round can cross vertical surfaces or difficult terrain at your full normal movement rate, provided you end the round standing upright on a surface that can bear your weight.
- **Dodge Doom:** Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action when caught in some explosion or other burst effect. You take half damage, or no damage if the effect allows a save and you succeed at it. You can move yourself up to ten feet away from your original location, provided the new location is behind cover or away from the blast’s point of origin.
- **Forced Engagement:** Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action when making an attack with your favored weapon; you may ignore one foe’s Screen Ally action for that attack.
- **Gentleman’s Withdrawal:** Commit Effort for the scene as a Move action. As part of this, you may move at your full movement rate without being hindered by armed foes unless they completely block your path. You count as having made a Fighting Withdrawal against any enemies engaged with you at the time.
- **Lightning Draw:** Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action at the start of hostilities; you win initiative against anyone without a similar ability to act first and may ready a Stowed favored weapon instantly.
- **Piercing Strike:** Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action and choose a visible target. For the rest of the scene, their AC is treated as 10 for purposes of resisting the Shock of your favored weapon.
- **Spiritual Weapon:** You are able to translate examples of your favored weapon into a spiritual template that you may manifest as you wish. Any favored weapon can be turned into such a template, including a magical weapon, but the process destroys the object’s physical form. To manifest a template, Commit Effort as an Instant action; a ghostly copy of the weapon appears Readied in hand for you until you release the Effort or stop touching the weapon. Dual-wielders can summon the same weapon into both hands with one use of this art.
- **Unbindable:** Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action whenever you wish to escape chains, grapples, shackles, ropes, or even a magical spell of physical binding. You automatically wriggle free from mundane restraints and gain an Evasion saving throw to instantly end a physical magical binding of some sort. You can use this art only once per round.
- **Unworthy Rabble:** Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action. For the rest of the scene, when using your favored weapon, reroll any failed hit roll against foes with one hit die. At eighth level, this applies to foes with two hit dice.
- **Whirling Evasion:** Your base Armor Class becomes equal to 13 plus half your level, rounded up. This AC can be modified by small shields and your Dexterity modifier, but not by armor or large shields.

### Elementalist

Elementalists are spellcasting Mages who focus on the manipulation of the material world around them. While they are capable of using High Magic, their specialist spells focus chiefly on wielding the classical elements of fire, air, water, and earth.

All Elementalists gain Magic as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level-1 if it was already level-0.

Elementalists can prepare and cast High Magic spells in addition to Elemental Magic. Elementalists can’t cast spells or use arts while armored or holding a shield.

Each time Elementalists advance a level, they can pick a new High Magic spell or an Elementalist spell to add to their spellbook. They must be able to cast the spell to add it to their selection.

| Level | Hit Dice | Attack Bonus | Focus Picks | Max Level | Spells Cast | Spells Prepared | Arts Gained                                         |

#### Elementalist Arts

Elementalist Effort is equal to one plus their Magic skill level plus the better of their Intelligence or Charisma modifiers. Partial Elementalists have a score one point lower than this, albeit not less than one.

Elementalists gain the Elemental Resilience and Elemental Sparks arts as part of their basic training, and may pick one additional art from the list below. Further arts are learned as they advance in character level, as given in the tables below.

- **Elemental Resilience:** You are unharmed by mundane extremes of cold or heat by less than that of a furnace. You suffer only half damage from magical or extremely intense flame or frost attacks.
- **Elemental Sparks:** You can conjure petty amounts of flame, water, ice, stone, or wind, sufficient to do small tricks, chill drinks, light candles, or do other minor things. Conjured substances last no longer than a scene, and conjured water cannot lastingly quench thirst. This art cannot actually be useful in solving a problem or overcoming a challenge more than once per game session.
- **Beckoned Deluge:** Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to conjure a considerable amount of water at a visible point within fifty feet per caster level. This water is sufficient to drench one 10-foot cubic meter per character level, making non-magical bowstrings useless, extinguishing flames, and inflicting 1d6 damage per caster level on fiery supernatural creatures. This water persists indefinitely after its conjuration and is sufficient to hydrate ten people per caster level.
- **Earthsight:** Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action. For the rest of the scene, you can see the outlines of solid objects even in perfect darkness, and can peer through a number of feet of earth or stone equal to your character level.
- **Elemental Blast:** Commit Effort for the scene as a Main Action to hurl a blast of some elemental force at a visible target within fifty feet per character level. The attack is made with Magic as the combat skill, Int, Cha, or Dex as the attribute, and a bonus to hit equal to your character level. It is not hindered by melee foes. On a hit, the attack does 1d6 damage plus your character level and attribute mod. The blast may have collateral effects on objects in the case of hurled fire or a torrent of pressurized water, but any conjured matter vanishes at the end of the round.
- **Flamesight:** Commit Effort as an On Turn action. While the Effort remains Committed, you can see thermal gradients sufficient to distinguish surfaces and living creatures, even in perfect darkness. Optionally, you may cause your own eyes to cast a light sufficient to illuminate your surroundings clearly out to a range of 30 feet.
- **Pavis of Elements:** Commit Effort as an On Turn action to conjure an elemental barrier around yourself. The barrier improves your Armor Class by +4 and remains as long as the Effort remains Committed. This bonus stacks with other effects, but cannot increase AC above 18, regardless of the combinations.
- **Petrifying Stare:** Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target a visible creature. The creature must make a Physical save or become partially petrified, losing its Move action for a number of rounds equal to half your caster level, rounded up. Flying creatures are forced to land by this art and swimming creatures will inevitably sink to the bottom.
- **Rune of Destruction:** Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target an adjacent solid surface. A glowing rune the size of a handprint forms on the surface and persists for one hour per caster level. Any creature who gets within two feet of the rune will trigger it, causing it to explode in a five-foot radius with an elemental force of your choice and suffering 2d6 damage plus your caster level. Creatures already within five feet of the rune when it is laid will not trigger it until they re-enter the area, nor will the caster trigger their own runes. Runes cannot overlap their areas of effect.
- **Steps of Air:** Commit Effort for the scene as an On Turn action and target a visible ally; for one round per caster level, the target can fly at their usual movement rate. If the art ends while they are still in the air, they descend harmlessly to the ground. This art may also be used as an Instant action to negate falling damage for any single target.
- **Stunning Shock:** Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action and target a visible creature within fifty feet per caster level. The target creature must be wearing or holding at least a pound worth of conductive metal or be considerably dampened. An electrical bolt leaps from the caster to stun the target, causing them to lose their next Main Action. A Physical saving throw can mitigate the effect, causing the target to lose their Move action instead of their Main. A creature can be targeted only once per scene by this.
- **Thermal Shield:** Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action to immediately negate one instance of fire or frost damage to any single visible ally or object. This defense lasts only long enough to nullify the single instance of damage.

### Healer

The Healer is a partial Mage that does not use spells. Instead, they gain specific arts that allow them to mend wounds, cure illnesses, and otherwise sustain their allies.

Healers gain Heal as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level-1 if they already have it at level-0. A basic grounding in mundane healing techniques is necessary in order to learn their more sophisticated magical arts.

Healers do not learn how to cast spells. Instead, they focus on their special arcane healing arts. Wielding these arts usually requires nothing more than touching the target and concentrating on the desired effect, and the process is direct and simple enough to perform even when burdened by armor or carrying a shield. These arts are usually quite subtle, and don’t produce visible or audible indications of their use.

At first level, a Healer gains the Healing Touch art and can pick one more of their choice. As they advance in levels afterwards, they can learn new arts. Once chosen, an art is permanent and cannot be exchanged.

#### Healer Arts

Healer Effort is calculated with Heal rather than Magic, with each PC’s maximum being equal to their Heal skill level plus the better of their Intelligence or Charisma modifiers, to a minimum of one point.

All Healers are trained in the Healing Touch art, but may develop other techniques with time.

| Level | Arts Gained                  |
|-------|------------------------------|
| 1     | Healing Touch and Any One    |
| 2     | Any One                      |
| 3     |                              |
| 4     | Any One                      |
| 5     | Any One                      |
| 6     | Any One                      |
| 7     |                              |
| 8     | Any One                      |
| 9     |                              |
| 10    | Any One                      |

- **Healing Touch:** Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action; for the rest of the scene, you may heal 2d6 damage plus your Heal skill to a touched ally as a Main Action. This healing adds 1 System Strain to the target each time it is applied.
- **Empowered Healer:** Your Healing Touch becomes more powerful, adding your level to any healing.
- **Facile Healer:** Your Healing Touch ability is improved, and you no longer need to Commit Effort to activate it.
- **Far Healer:** Your Healing Touch ability is improved, and may be used on a visible target within ten feet per character level.
- **Final Repose:** Target a visible living creature and Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action. For the rest of the scene, they take a Physical saving throw penalty equal to your Heal skill. If they are reduced to zero hit points before the end of the scene, they die with no chance for stabilization or revival.
- **Healer’s Eye:** Commit Effort as an On Turn action; while the Effort remains committed, you can use a Main Action to visually detect diseases and poisons, diagnose creatures flawlessly, perceive their physiology, and learn their current hit point totals. As a side effect, you can detect living creatures by sight regardless of available light or obscuring mists.
- **Limb Restoration:** Only expert healers can master this art, which cannot be learned earlier than 8th level. You must Commit all remaining Effort for the day, a minimum of one point, to regenerate a missing limb or organ for a target you are touching, or efface some dramatic scar or other physical debility. The target’s System Strain is automatically maximized.
- **Purge Ailment**: Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action. An ally you are touching is cured of one poison or disease. Creatures killed by poison can be revived by this art if it is used within six minutes of death. Magical poisons and diseases may require a Wis/Heal or Cha/Heal skill check against a difficulty of 8 or more. At seventh level, you need only Commit Effort for the scene to use this ability. Refined Restoration: You and up to a dozen allies you tend before they sleep will all lose 2 System Strain from a good night’s rest instead of 1.
- **Revive the Fallen**: Only expert healers are capable of mastering this art, which cannot be learned earlier than 8th level. Commit Effort for the day as a Main Action to revive a recently-slain living creature that you are touching. This ability must be used on a target within one minute per caster level of their death, and will not work on a corpse that has been dismembered, incinerated, or otherwise disjected. The target’s System Strain is automatically maximized and they’ll be unconscious for twenty-four hours after their restoration before awakening with 1 hit point.
- **Swift Healer**: Your Healing Touch ability is improved, and may be used as an On Turn action once per day per character level, though not more than once per round on any given target.
- **Tireless Vigor**: Commit Effort; while it remains Committed your need to eat, drink, breathe, or sleep does not grow further. You may exert yourself tirelessly and regenerate 1 lost hit point per hour.
- **Vital Furnace**: Your tremendous life energy can be used to instantly regenerate any non-mortal wound you have received. Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to negate the damage from an injury you just received that did not reduce you to zero hit points. Aside from this ability, you automatically stabilize if reduced to zero hit points and awaken ten minutes later with 1 hit point. This ability cannot undo damage you intentionally inflict on yourself via some power or magical exchange.

### High Mage

High Mages represent the default spellcaster in most campaigns. Their spells tend to be generalist in nature rather than focusing on particular specific themes, but their arts make them extremely skilled at manipulating and augmenting the magics they use.

High Mages gain Magic as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level-1 if it was already level-0. Every High Mage is well-educated in the principles of magic as understood by the sorcerers of this world.

High Mages can prepare and cast High Magic spells, and have a number of arts dedicated to improving their use of these incantations. They cannot wear bulky clothing or armor while casting or using arts, nor use shields.

High Mages conduct extensive experimentation and study as part of their daily activities. Each time they advance a level, they may pick two High Magic spells from the list in this book to add to their repertoire. These spells must be of a level they can cast.

#### High Mage Arts

High Mage Effort is equal to one plus their Magic skill level plus the better of their Intelligence or Charisma modifiers. Partial High Mages have a score one point lower than this, albeit not less than one.

- **Arcane Lexicon:** Commit Effort for the scene. For the rest of the scene, you can read any script that was not intentionally obfuscated or encoded by its writer. Extremely esoteric or nonhuman scripts may not be comprehensible this way; the “plain meaning” of the text might be utterly foreign to human logic.
- **Counter Magic:** Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action when a visible enemy mage casts a spell. Both of you make opposed Int/Magic or Cha/Magic skill checks; if you win, their spell fizzles and is wasted. This art only works on actual spellcasters and not creatures that merely activate magical powers. You can use this art no more than once per round.
- **Empowered Sorcery:** Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to re-roll any variable die roll associated with a spell’s effects, such as a damage roll; take the roll you prefer.
- **Hang Sorcery:** Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action when casting a spell. The spell does not go off, but remains “hung” and waiting to be triggered as an On Turn action, with details of targeting and effect determined at that time. Damage does not disrupt a hung spell, but no additional spells can be cast until the hung spell is released or allowed to dissipate.
- **Inexorable Effect:** Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to force an enemy to re-roll a successful saving throw and take the worse result. You may use this art only once per scene.
- **Iron Resolution:** Commit Effort for the day when injured or disturbed in combat; you may make a Physical saving throw to resist spell disruption and ignore the damage for purposes of spellcasting.
- **Preparatory Countermagic**: Commit Effort for the scene when you are affected by a spell you have prepared, including when you are standing in the area of effect of one of your own damaging spells. You are unaffected by the spell’s direct effects.
- **Psychic Conversion**: Once per day as an On Turn action, expend one casting slot to remove one point of accrued System Strain and heal 2 hit points per level.
- **Restrained Casting**: Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action when casting a High Magic spell. You may do so in perfect silence and without need for somatic gestures, though damage will still disrupt the casting.
- **Retain Sorcery**: Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action after casting a spell; it does not count against your casting limits for the day. You can use this art no more than once per day, and the stress of using it prevents you from casting another spell before the end of your next turn.
- **Sense Magic**: Commit Effort as an Instant action; while it remains committed, you can visually perceive magical energy and get a one-sentence description of the effect of any standing magics or magical items you inspect. The ambient magical energies in most areas allow you to see clearly even in conditions of perfect darkness. Suppress Magic: Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action and target a visible or known magical effect within one hundred feet. The effect is suppressed as if by the Extirpate Arcana spell for 1d6 rounds plus the caster’s character level. Spells cast by more powerful casters may not be successfully suppressed, as noted in the spell description. The caster can attempt to suppress an effect only once.
- **Swift Casting**: Once per scene, you may Commit Effort for the day to turn a spell that normally requires a Main Action to cast into an On Turn action. You can cast no other spell this round and you can’t use this art if you’ve already cast a spell this round or been injured or otherwise disqualified from casting.
- **Ward Allies**: Commit Effort for the day as an Instant action to omit up to six allies from the effects of an area-effect spell you cast, allowing them to avoid any damage or other negative effect that would be directly produced by the spell. This does not protect them from indirect consequences, however, such as destroying the building they are standing in.
- **Wizard’s Grandeur**: Commit Effort as an On Turn action. As long as it remains Committed, you will not become dirty, sweaty, stained, or rumpled regardless of the circumstances. Noxious substances will slide off you without staining and you will remain comfortable regardless of your attire in any normal climate. You may sleep comfortably without shelter or bedding as per the privation rules.

### Necromancer

Necromancers are spellcasting Mages who deal with the energies of life and death.

Necromancers gain Magic as a bonus skill, acquiring it at level-0, or level-1 if was already level-0.

Necromancers can prepare and cast High Magic spells in addition to the spells specific to Necromatic Magic. Necromancers can’t cast spells or use arts while armored or holding a shield.

Each time a Necromancer advances a level, they can pick a new High Magic spell or a Necromancer spell to add to their spellbook. They must be able to cast the spell to add it to their selection.

#### Necromancer Arts

Necromancer Effort is equal to one plus their Magic skill level plus the better of their Intelligence or Charisma modifiers. Partial Necromancers have a score one point lower than this, albeit not less than one.

- **Bonetalker:** You can see and communicate with any undead creature, regardless of a shared language or the creature’s natural state of invisibility. By Committing Effort for the scene you can sense the surface thoughts of any visible undead, including an impression of any commands or behavior it has been ordered to carry out. Unintelligent undead will not attack you or your companions unless specifically compelled to do so by a command or a master. Even intelligent undead will generally pause at least for an initial parley before attacking.
- **Cold Flesh:** You no longer require sleep and feel pain only in an abstract sense. You can suffer no more than 2 points of damage from any given instance of Shock and you have a natural Armor Class equal to 12 plus half your level, rounded down.
- **Consume Life Energy:** By making a Punch attack or using a melee weapon you have spent at least an hour properly consecrating, you can absorb a portion of the damage you inflict on others as healing to yourself. For each successful attack you make with such implements, you heal 1d6 damage, up to a maximum of the damage done by the attack. You cannot drain more life than the target has remaining hit points.
- **False Death:** Commit Effort as an Instant action; while it remains Committed you appear dead to all mundane examination. You lose your Main Actions while “dead”, but can move and perceive normally and do not need to eat, drink, breathe, or perform other bodily functions. Poisons and diseases do not progress in you while you are “dead”. You can maintain this state of death for up to one day per level before needing at least an hour to recover.
- **Gravesight**: Commit Effort as an On Turn action; while it remains Committed, you can see the life energies of living creatures around you as various glowing patterns, regardless of the mundane illumination available. You can perceive sicknesses, poisons, and other physical qualities on sight. As a side effect of this ability, you can see normally even in perfect blackness.
- **Keeper of the Gate**: At your discretion, creatures within twenty feet of you per character level that are Mortally Wounded will die instantly and cannot be revived by magic or medicine. Conversely, you can Commit Effort for the day to automatically stabilize any or all within that range, increasing their System Strain by 1 point. This benefit cannot aid creatures that have been dismembered, shredded, or otherwise suffered unsurvivable injuries.
- **Life Bridge**: You can transfer life force between willing or helpless participants. Commit Effort for the day; for the rest of the scene, you can shift hit points from one willing or helpless target no smaller than a dog to another as a Main Action, provided you are touching both. You can shift enough hit points to Mortally Wound a donor, but you can’t give more to the recipient than would refresh their maximum allowed hit points.
- **Master of Bones**: Undead must roll twice to save versus your abilities or spells and take the worse roll. You may Commit Effort for the scene as an Instant action to negate any single attack, magical power or spell an undead uses against you. Undead with more than twice as many hit dice as you have levels cannot be foiled this way.
- **Red Harvest**: You are empowered by death. As an Instant action, whenever an intelligent living creature with at least one hit die perishes within fifty feet of you, Commit Effort for the day to either heal 1d6 plus your level in lost hit points or gain a +4 bonus on your next hit roll this scene. This art cannot be stacked, and it can be used only once per round.
- **Unaging**: You no longer naturally age, and will remain perfectly hale and vigorous up to your species’ natural maximum age plus 20% per character level, after which you will collapse into dust and decay. Immortality beyond this point is possible, but generally requires consistent supplies of life energy, occult materials, or other difficult-to-acquire or morally questionable materials. You also become immune to poisons and diseases.
- **Uncanny Ichor**: Your blood is not like the blood of normal beings. Predators find it nauseating and will not bite you unless provoked. Unintelligent predators will not consider you edible. This ichor is reluctant to leave your body, and stabbing or puncture injuries can Mortally Wound you but cannot result in your death unless you are entirely pincushioned by your foes or suffer catastrophic physical damage.
- **Unliving Persistence**: Commit Effort for the day as an On Turn action to automatically stabilize when Mortally Wounded. You may use this ability to benefit others if you are able to touch them. This ability cannot save a subject that has experienced dismemberment or other extremely final deaths.

## Record Maximum Hit Points

Your character’s hit points measure their distance from defeat or death. If your character is reduced to zero hit points, they are either dying or incapacitated based on the nature of the injury.

A new character rolls the hit die for their class, adding their Constitution modifier to it. If they have chosen the Die Hard Focus they may add +2 to the roll. The final value for a given die cannot be less than 1 hit point.

A character gains hit points as they advance in character level, rerolling their prior levels and taking the new score if it’s higher, as explained in the rules section.

## Record Attack Bonus

Your character has a certain degree of basic combat competence based on their class. This bonus increases as you advance in character levels and is added to your attack roll.

A new character’s attack bonus is usually +0, though Full Warriors start with a +1 base attack bonus.

## Record Saving Throws

When faced with unusual dangers such as fireball explosions, toxic darts, pit traps, or magical curses, the character may need to make a saving throw to resist or mitigate the peril. Saving throws are rolled on a d20 and are explained in the rules section.

Physical saving throws are used to resist exhaustion, disease, poison, or other biological harms. A new character’s Physical save target is equal to 15 minus the better of their Strength or Constitution modifiers.

Evasion saving throws are used to avoid explosions, traps, or other dangers requiring fast reactions. A new character’s Evasion save target is equal to 15 minus the better of their Intelligence or Dexterity modifiers.

Mental saving throws are used to resist intangible spells, mental attacks, or other tests of willpower or self-control. A new character’s Mental save target is equal to 15 minus the better of their Wisdom or Charisma modifiers.

Luck saving throws are rolled when facing a danger that only blind chance can spare them from, such as landslide, bridge collapse, or a sniper’s random choice of victims. A new character’s Luck save target is always 15.

A character’s save targets all decrease by 1 point each time they advance an experience level.

## Mages Choose Starting Spells

Spellcasting full Mages begin play knowing four first-level spells and partial Mages begin play knowing two. Delvers with two partial spellcasting Mage classes, such as a partial Necromancer/partial High Mage know four. These spells may be chosen from any spell list available to them. A new High Mage, for example, would pick first-level spells from the High Magic spell list, while a new Elementalist could pick them from either the High Magic or Elementalist spells.

## Choose Starting Gear

Gain 3d6 x 10 gold to spend on gear or keep in your pocket.

## Record Weapon and Armor Statistics

Now that you know what kind of weaponry or armor your delver has,
take a moment to record the total hit bonus for your weaponry. This is equal to your attack bonus plus your relevant Stab, Shoot, or Punch skill, and the relevant attribute modifier for the weapon given on the weapon table. If two attributes are listed for a weapon, use whichever is better for you. If you lack even level-0 skill in the weapon, take a -2 hit penalty with it.

For each weapon’s damage and Shock, note down the information from the table. You add your attribute modifier to both damage rolls and Shock. Punch weapons or unarmed attacks can also add your Punch skill.

For your PC’s Armor Class, record the AC of the armor you usually wear. Unarmored humans have an AC of 10. Armor Class is modified by your Dexterity modifier.
