# Character Creation

Adventuring is a profession, and all Characters have undergone extensive training to become 1st level. They can clean and sharpen weapons, set up camp, cook meals, ride mounts, perform first aid, know the value of coins, trade goods, treasure, and identify common magical effects and monsters.


1. **Generate Attributes**. For each of the five [Attributes](/rules#attributes) (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom), assign them a score of `3d6` **in order**. So your first `3d6` is your Strength, your second is your Dexterity, and so on.

1. **Choose a character concept**. Discuss what your role will be in the team. A well-rounded party needs a way to deal with melee enemies, a way to deal with ranged or flying enemies, a way to deal with mundane security measures (guards, locked doors, traps), a way to deal with magical security measures, and a way to keep everyone healthy when things go south. A team of a melee-focused [Warrior](/classes#warrior), [Sneak](/rules#sneak)-focused [Expert](/classes#expert), utility-focued [High Mage](/arcane-traditions#high-mage), and [Partial Warrior](/classes#partial-warrior)/[Healer](/arcane-traditions#healer) is well-rounded, but part of the fun is trying out other compositions.

1. **Raise an Attribute to 14**. With your role on the team in mind, choose an [Attribute](/rules#attributes) to raise to 14.

1. **Record Skills**. There are 9 [Skills](/rules#skills): [Exert](/rules#exert), [Heal](/rules#heal), [Know](/rules#know), [Magic](/rules#magic), [Notice](/rules#notice), [Sneak](/rules#sneak), [Brawl](/rules#brawl), [Shoot](/rules#shoot), and [Stab](/rules#stab). Record the name of each skill and write `-1` next to it, to represent an initial lack of training.

1. **Starting Improvements**. Make a total of 4 <span id="improvement">Improvements<span> to your [Skills](/rules#skills) or [Attributes](/rules#attributes). To improve an [Attribute](/rules#attributes), raise it by 1 to a max of 18. To improve a [Skill](/rules#skills), raise its level by 1 to a max of 1. All skills start at level -1. A single [Attribute](/rules#attributes) or [Skill](/rules#skills) can be improved multiple times. [Brawl](/rules#brawl), [Shoot](/rules#shoot), and [Stab](/rules#stab) are primarily used for making [Attack Rolls](/combat#attack-rolls). All skills are used for making [Skill Checks](/rules#skill-checks).

1. **Choose a Class**. Pick either a full [Class](/classes) or combine two Partial Classes. [Warriors](/classes#warrior) are great at [combat](/combat), [Experts](/classes#expert) are great at [Skill Checks](/rules#skill-checks), and [Mages](/classes#mage) have specialized [powers](/arcane-traditions) or [spells](/spells).

1. **Choose Feats**. Each [Class](/classes) gets a different starting amount of [Feats](/feats) at first level, detailed in the class' "Feats" column. Some [Feats](/feats), like [Alert](/feats#alert-c) grant a [Bonus Skill](/rules#bonus-skill). Raise that skill by one level to a maximum of level 1. If that skill is *already* level 1, make a free [Improvement](#improvement).

1. **Record Attribute Modifiers**. Each [Attribute](/rules#attributes) has a [Modifier](/rules#attribute-modifiers), ranging from -2 to +2 based on its score. This modifier is added to [Skill Checks](/rules#skill-checks), [Attack Rolls](/combat#attack-rolls), [Damage](/combat#damage) rolls, [Shock](/combat#shock) damage, and [Saving Throws](/rules#saving-throws).

1. **Generate Maximum Hit Points**. Each [Class](/classes) gets different amount of [Hit Points](/rules#hit-points) (HP) at first level according to their [HP Progression](/rules#hp-progression). Roll based on your class, add your CON, and +2 if you chose the [Die Hard](/feats#die-hard-c) Feat.

1. **Record Attack Bonus**. Your character has a certain degree of basic combat competence based on their class. This bonus increases as you advance in character levels and is added to your attack roll. A new characterâ€™s attack bonus is usually +0, though [Warriors](/classes#warrior) start with a +1 attack bonus.

1. **Record Derived Statistics**. Record your [Physical](/rules#physical) (exhaustion, poison, etc), [Evasion](/rules#evasion) (explosions, traps, etc), and [Mental](/rules#mental) (mind control, tests of will, etc) [Saving Throws](/rules#saving-throws).
  - Your [Physical](/rules#physical) score is 15 minus the highest of your STR and CON.
  - Your [Evasion](/rules#evasion) score is 15 minus the highest of your INT and DEX.
  - Your [Mental](/rules#mental) score is 15 minus the highest of your INT and WIS.
  - Record your maximum [System Strain](/rules#system-strain), which is equal to your Constitution.

1. **Choose Starting Gear**. Gain `3d6 x 10` gold to spend on [gear](/equipment) (ignoring [Equipment Availability](/equipment#equipment-availability)), noting thier [Encumbrance](/rules#encumbrance) and whether they are [Readied](/rules#readied) or [Stowed](/rules#stowed). You may carry [Readied](/rules#readied) equipment equal to half your Strength rounded down. You may carry [Stowed](/rules#stowed) equipment equal to your Strength. Other party members may be willing to Stow gear for you.

1. **Record Weapon Statistics**. For each weapon (or special Art) you attack with, record its properties.
  - Write it's name. *For example* `Sword:`.
  - Record the total attack bonus for that weapon. This is equal to your attack bonus plus your relevant [Stab](/rules#stab), [Shoot](/rules#shoot), or [Brawl](/rules#brawl) skill, and the relevant [Attribute Modifier](/rules#attribute-modifiers) for the weapon given on the weapon table. If two attributes are listed for a weapon, use whichever is better for you. *For example*, a [Warrior](/classes#warrior) (attack bonus of +1) with a STR of +1 and a [Stab](/rules#stab) of +1 has a total attack bonus of +3. They record `Sword: +3`.
  - Record the weapon's damage from the [Weapon Table](/equipment#weapons), adding your relevant [Attribute Modifier](/rules#attribute-modifiers) (like STR or DEX). Abilities like the Warrior's [Killing Blow](/classes#class-ability-killing-blow) and Feats like [Armsmaster](/feats#armsmaster-c) also increase damage. *For example*, A [Warrior](/classes#warrior) (+1 from [Killing Blow](/classes#class-ability-killing-blow)) with a STR of +1, the [Armsmaster](/feats#armsmaster-c) Feat, and a [Stab](/rules#stab) of +1 wielding a [sword](/equipment#sword) (1d8) records `Sword: +3 -> 1d8+3`.
  - Record the weapon's [Shock](/combat#shock) from the [Weapon Table](/equipment#weapons), adding the relevant [Attribute Modifier](/rules#attribute-modifiers). Abilities like the [Warrior's](/classes#warrior) [Killing Blow](/classes#class-ability-killing-blow) and Feats like [Armsmaster](/feats#armsmaster-c) also increase [Shock](/combat#shock). *For example*, A [Warrior](/classes#warrior) (+1 from [Killing Blow](/classes#class-ability-killing-blow)) with a STR of +1, the [Armsmaster](/feats#armsmaster-c) Feat, and a [Stab](/rules#stab) of +1 wielding a [sword](/equipment#sword) (2/AC 13) records `Sword: +3 -> 1d8+3, Sh 5/AC 13`.

1. **Record Armor Class**. Record the [Armor Class](/equipment#armor-class) (AC) of the armor you normally wear. AC is modified by DEX. For example, a character wearing [plate armor](/equipment#plate) with a DEX of +2 has 18 AC.

1. **Mages Choose Starting Spells**. [High Mages](/arcane-traditions#high-mage), [Elementalists](/arcane-traditions#elementalist), and [Necromancers](/arcane-traditions#necromancer) begin play knowing [Spells](/spells) based on their [Arcane Tradition](/arcane-traditions). These spells are chosen from any spell list available to them. Full [Mages](/classes#mage) choose 4 starting spells, and [Partial Mages](/classes#partial-mage) choose 2. A new full [High Mage](/arcane-traditions#high-mage), for example, would pick four first-level spells from the [High Magic spell list](/spells#high-magic-spells), while a new partial [Elementalist](/arcane-traditions#elementalist) could pick two spells total from either the [High Magic](/spells#high-magic-spells) or [Elementalist spell list](/spells#elementalist-spells).

1. **Mages Record Effort**. All Mages start with a pool of [Effort](/classes#effort) specific to their class. Refer to your chosen [Arcane Tradition](/arcane-traditions) section for how to calculate it. For example, an [Elementalist](/arcane-traditions#elementalist) refers to [Elementalist Arts](/arcane-traditions#elementalist-arts).

1. **Mages Choose Starting Arts**. All [Mages](/classes#mage) select Arts based on their [Arcane Tradition](/arcane-traditions). Refer to your chosen tradition for specific details. For example, a [Duelist](/arcane-traditions#duelist) refers to [Duelist Arts](/arcane-traditions#duelist-arts).

1. **Record Level and XP.** Characters start at Level 1 with 0 XP, and need 1500 XP to [advance](/rules#xp-thresholds).

1. **Create Descriptive Details**. Imagine an appearance, brief history, personality, mannerisms, and motivations for your character. Bear in mind that your character *will be* going on adventures and *will be* part of a team. Endeavor to create a character that *wants* to go on adventures, and *wants* to be part of a team.
