# Running The Game

This document is written for a fresh GM, but veteran GMs may still find useful ideas. Most of these ideas are not original, rather they have been consolidated from dozens of books and hundreds of [blogs](https://campaignwiki.org/osr/).

## Getting a Group Together

I *highly* recommend trying to play in-person. The easy way to do this is to ask friends to play. If that's not an option, or to fill in extra seats at the table, the [looking for group subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/) works. I can personally vouch for it. There are other services like [startplaying.games](https://startplaying.games/search).

Finally, it's worth advertising at your friendly local game store. They often let people reserve tables or have a dedicated night. If you google "friendly local game store near me", you'll hopefully get some nearby places. If you don't, experiment with... moving to a city. Once you find one, call them and ask about D&D, that's usually way faster than trying to navigate bespoke (and frequently out of date) websites.

## Actually Playing

Get people together, *noncommittally* to see if they like playing in your game. Make sure they're safe, and that you'd be comfortable having them in your house. I like to have lunch with people at a restaurant before inviting them to my home (sort of like how dating works), but meeting at a game store in the beginning works too.

Once you have a group together, **fully commit** to a schedule. There's a line from ACKs 2e that I like a lot:

> If you’re planning to start a successful campaign, you need to explain to your friends that you are not hosting a series of social events. You are starting an intramural sports team and asking them if they’d like to be on the team.

At social events, it's okay for people to bail or show up late. In team sports, it's *not okay*. They're *letting the team down*. This is a *commitment*. If that scares them off, that's fine! Find someone who *really* wants to play. Lots of people *pay* for a game master, no one pays for players. Plenty of people really do want to be there; find those people. Setting this expectation properly will save more grief than anything else.

Even so, stuff will come up. Birthday parties, holidays, travel, etc. Make it clear ahead of time that you'll play so long as half of the players can make it. Decide up front what to do with the characters of the players who aren't there. Some folks are unattached, and don't mind if someone else pilots their character. Some people *love* their character, or no one feels comfortable accepting that responsibility. In these cases, I handwave those characters away. Trying to narratively explain how these characters pop in and out isn't worth it. Just tell the players this. For example:

**GM**: You check the door - it's locked. What do you do?

**Alice**: Dang - Bob's (who is on vacation) character Bogdan is the one with all the [Sneak](/rules#sneak). Can his character pick the lock?

**GM**: No - though I think Bob should be around for next session. Bogdan *just isn't here* and I'm not going to try to figure out how to explain the dissapearance or his smooth reappearance next week, I've tried before and it's always too weird.

**Alice**: Hah - fine, so maybe we... bash the door in?

## Handling Interpersonal Problems

Just talk to them. Seriously. Don't post about it on social media and ask for advice. Don't do mean stuff to their characters as retribution. Tell them how your behavior is impacting you, and suggest other ways for them to behave instead. Listen to them. Not everyone is a good fit for every table. It's totally fine to let folks know that they aren't a good fit for the table. It doesn't need to be dramatic and shouldn't be (sort of like dating).

## Necessary Materials

- [Pens](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXWGWE). I personally use a [Pilot Prera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016YYKUA).
- [Pencils](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQQ05JA).
- [Paper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FV0F8H8).
- [Dice](https://www.amazon.com/Chessex-001LBCHX-Pound-O-Dice/dp/B008C0KXYS). I *highly* recommend folks use a different color for each size of dice as they're learning.
- [Card Stock](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FX5LCXK). For item and spell handouts.
- [Scissors](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Multipurpose-Titanium-Stainless/dp/B01BRGU8R0). For cutting out character sheets, items and spell handouts.
- [A Battlemap](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQHECUR). This one is dry-erase compatible, which is great.  For travel, I like [silicone maps](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0763QJQ8C).
- [Dry Erase Markers](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T3ROM9G). If you have a wet erase battlemap, get wet erase markers instead.
- [Meeples](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BZ36NYJ). Label each color 1 through 10 with a Sharpie and use them for monsters.
- Delver Icons: [Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016DSBNY4) + [Epoxy Stickers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFRWIRQ) + [Hole Punch](https://www.amazon.com/Bira-Circle-Craft-Crafting-Scrapbooking/dp/B07B43X316). From [JP Coovert's Youtube](https://youtu.be/LBZPi4oKlCQ?si=mTP5tiOjJyb1ITeu).
- [Printer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09961WKKS). Good for printing modules, character sheets, maps, handouts, etc.
- [Awl](https://www.amazon.com/General-Tools-818-Hardwood-Scratch/dp/B00004T7R3). Sewn digest modules lay much more nicely than stapled ones.
- [Needle and Thread](https://www.amazon.com/Simthread-Purpose-Thread-Polyester-Yards/dp/B0B9FQ2QN4). For binding modules.
- [3 Ring Binder](https://www.amazon.com/Samsill-Economy-Ring-Binder-5-Round/dp/B07FKXHP1H). Some modules are natively printed on big paper (like Castle Xyntillan) and printing them out digest style makes the font painfully small. For these, we use a hole punch and a 3 ring binder. Additionally, GM notes go in a separate 3-ring binder.
- [3 Hole Punch](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Hole-Punch-Sheet-Capacity/dp/B0879YNTTP).

The specific product recommendations are all optional. At a higher level, you need some way to:

- Record character information (pencil and paper)
- Generate random numbers (dice)
- Take GM notes (pen, paper, 3-ring binder)
- Read adventures (printer and paper)
- Prepare adventures (pen, printed adventure)
- Represent a battle (battle map, markers, meeples, delver icons)

As long as you have these things handled, you're good.

## Preparing an Adventure

Read the module cover to cover. Then, start back at the beginning and try to mentally answer each one of these questions:

- How does the game start?
- Does each faction have a goal?
- For each room:
  - Is it clear what I should say when the players enter the room?
  - Does each trap and secret door have a mechanism and tell?
  - Does it have all of the information necessary to run it?
  - Do the details in the room have internal consistency?
  - Are stat blocks accurate and complete?
  - Do magic items have a description?
- Do the bespoke mechanics work in play?
- Does the key match the map?
- Is the amount of treasure appropriate for the risk?
- Can I replace random values with pre-rolled results?

For an *involved* demonstration of this process, check out my [Audit of Tower Silveraxe](https://rancourt.substack.com/p/audit-tower-silveraxe).

### How Does the Game Start?

Some dungeons, like Borshak's Lair, *just* detail a dungeon. Here, you're using [hard framing](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/31509/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-pacing) to narrate how they found out about the dungeon, what information they gathered, their trip to the dungeon, and what it looks from the outside.

For instance

> At Slarkeron the Wizard's behest, you venture past the Valley of Barzak Bragoth, around Lake Shimron, and just north of Tol Bandur to the ancient tomb of Lord Helmdar.
>
> Slarkeron says that a rival named Tim the Moonslayer claimed the tomb and created a tunnel complex for his crazed experiments but hasn't been heard from in decades.
>
> You arrive at a stairway leading deep under the earth. The walls are moist but not slimy; the air is cool, damp, and silent. What do you do?

Other adventures, like [The Evils of Illmire](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/343439) detail a town and multiple nearby dungeons. It is *usually* safe to start the players in the town, let them gather information about the adventure, and choose where to go. If the town is weakly detailed, nothing interesting to do in town, or there's no real choice about where to go, we [skip forward](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/31509/roleplaying-games/the-art-of-pacing) to the dungeon entrance, letting the town fade into the background as a place for the adventures to return to to resupply or recover [System Strain](/rules#system-strain).

If this is the first session, **strongly** consider starting them at the entrance to a dungeon rather than in a town.

### Factions

I love GFC's [take on factions](https://guccifuligincloak.blogspot.com/2020/01/the-four-blanks-method-of-faction.html). The summary is that you should be able to write

> [FACTION] wants [MOTIVATION], but [OBSTACLE]; therefore, [METHOD OF SURMOUNTING OBSTACLE]

for each faction. If the faction doesn’t want anything, it’s hard to know how to get them to act or how they’ll react. If nothing is stopping them from getting what they want, why don’t they have it? If they’re not trying to remove their obstacle, what are they doing, and do they actually want the thing?

Read through the factions in the adventure (and dungeon), and make sure they're at least this complex. If they aren't, flesh them out! The [Parley](/rules#parley) information has some sample motivations for each kind of creature:

**Dragons** want food, territory, treasure, and domination.

**Humanoids** want territory, treasure, domination, or higher order concepts like fairness, kindness, loyalty, obediency, and sanctity.

**Giants** are obsessed in their place in the hierarchy of Giants, and anything that will help them climb that hierarchy.

**Undead** and **constructs** are compelled by whatever directive created them.

**Fiends** want to cause suffering.

**Aberrations** have intentionally alien, unintelligible motives.

**Fey** have emotional motives, often following dream logic or the [seven deadly sins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_deadly_sins) (gluttony, lust, greed, sorrow, wrath, sloth, pride).

It's helpful if the motivations, obstacles, and methods of different factions overlap somehow. Have two factions want the same thing, or two different factions are blocked by the same obstacle.

A neat way of visualizing this is given by [Murkdice](https://murkdice.substack.com/p/make-factions-fight).

### Room By Room

#### Initial Description

The easiest is when adventures provide *well written* read-aloud text. For instance, here's [Temple of 1000 Swords](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/360211):

![300](/assets/images/1000-swords-3.png)

You just read it! As you're reading through each room, check to make sure that it avoids the [classic pitfalls](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/48312/roleplaying-games/gm-dont-list-13-boxed-text-pitfalls):

- Do not describe reactable action while assuming the players are doing nothing.
- Do not declare the actions or thoughts of the Delvers.

Or in other words, focus on the *scene* - what the Delvers see, hear, and smell. When you describe something that they might want to react to, stop *then* and ask "what do you do?"

The second easiest is when there's formatted text. Here's [The Black Wyrm of Brandonsford](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/327744/the-black-wyrm-of-brandonsford):

![400](/assets/images/brandonsford-5.png)

This is still easy enough to run it at the table with no modification.

> You see four statues, 8' tall, one in each corner of the room. There appears to be something etched into each statue's base, but you're not close enough read them. You hear the sound of dripping water from the northwest. What do you do?

When cobbling this sort of reading together, we want to make sure we *assume no action*. Here's a video of a guy [exploring a cave by torchlight](https://youtu.be/lp0b165mHqw?si=GqU3XbKgiCJcnSnM&t=777). Torchlight is *not enough* to be able to read text from a distance; they need to get right up next to it. We don't assume that players *move* drapes to see what's behind them, or open containers to see what's in them. We save those details for the [Core Gameplay Loop](/rules#core-gameplay-loop).

The hardest is dense text; the denser and longer the more work we need to do. Many of the 80s TSR modules used descriptions like this. Here's [Keep on the Borderlands](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/17158/B2-The-Keep-on-the-Borderlands-Basic)

![400](/assets/images/keep-on-the-borderlands-13.png)

Note how the description of the room is *buried* in the text. After we print out the module, we grab a highlighter and highlight the bits we need for the initial description.

![400](/assets/images/keep-on-the-borderlands-13-highlighted.png).

Now, it's much easier to cobble together or initial reading:

> You see a small table and two chairs in the middle of the room. There's a wooden chest pushed up against the east wall, and two shields are hung on the south wall. Among other odds and ends, is an old bucket, resting on something; clearly elevated. What do you do?

Finally, as we're going through each room, we want to mark out irrelevant text. Filler words, mundane descriptions of exits (implied by the map), and objects that would obviously be in a room (like describing there are pots and pans in a kitchen).

For instance, here's [Tower Silveraxe](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/358825/in-the-shadow-of-tower-silveraxe):

> 14) ~~There are 2 doors here; northwest and southeast. The room is otherwise empty.~~

or

> 5) ~~This hall is long and has a few exits and turns. See map.~~

or

> 4) ~~A large room with 4 doors and~~ a round 10’ pool in the middle. The pool is purely decorative.

#### Traps

There are two good sources on this, both of which say the same thing: [A Treatise on Traps - GFC](https://guccifuligincloak.blogspot.com/2021/11/a-treatise-on-traps.html) and [Stop Hiding Traps - Ben Milton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RY_IRqx5dtI).

GFC's is more procedural and I *love* a good procedure. Each trap needs to have a mechanism (causes the trap to spring and informs how it can be disabled), a consequence (what happens if the trap is sprung), and a tell (how the Delvers could tell it's there).

Unfortunately, most modules *only* describe the consequence. During our room-by-room pass, we'll make sure that each trap has all three components.

For example, from [Stonehell](https://www.lulu.com/shop/michael-curtis/stonehell-dungeon-down-night-haunted-halls/paperback/product-1v8vy2zz.html):

> (22) **Gas Fountain**: Dry stone fountain adorned with a statue of a leaping fish. Fish spouts poison gas (2 in 6 chance; save vs. poison or die) in 10‘×10‘ cloud if the fountain is disturbed.

There's *sort* of a mechanism (disturbing the fountain), no tell, but *definitely* a consequence (death).

It's hard to imagine how the statue could be rigged up with a purely mechanical sensor delicate enough that any disturbance causes it to release poison gas. Especially one complex enough that it can be re-armed (if it can't be re-armed, then it should have been triggered long ago).

The easiest thing here is to make it magical, and then attach a few [ethereal hooks](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/12909/roleplaying-games/thought-of-the-day-disarming-magical-traps) that [Sense Magic](/arcane-traditions#sense-magic) or [See Magic](/spells#see-magic) would pick up on.

For the tell, we can say that the fish's mouth has a finger-sized hole in it that runs deep into the statue (where the gas comes out).

Putting it all together, The statue has several ethereal hooks running from it to the ground. Pushing or turning the statue might (2-in-6 chance) tug on one of the hooks, and trigger a magic item inside the statue capable of producing poison gas. The gas travels from the interior out the fish's mouth.

Unless an adventure *specifically* mentions otherwise, traps only have a 2-in-6 chance to trigger even if their trigger explicitly happens. You can walk over pit traps 4/6ths of the time; you miss tripwires 4/6th of the time, etc. Roll for *each triggering action*. For instance, if a party of 7 Delvers walks over a tripwire, roll 7 times.

#### Full Information

Make sure that all of the things that affect the room are explained *in the room*. There are three main things to look for:

- Switches/levers/etc that exist in other rooms that affect *this* room.
- "Keys" from other rooms for "locks" in this room.

For an example of the first, here's [Hole in the Oak](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/284852):

> **(29) Plinth and Chalice**
>
> Stone plinth (4' high). Bathed in golden light (a 10' diameter pool of light surrounds the plinth). Platinum and sapphire chalice (upon the plinth, worth 2,000gp, full of water).
>
> Stepping into the light: 2d6 evil tree babies leap from the trees and attack.

which is related to:

> **(24) Control Room**
> ...
> Pulling lever 4: Deactivates the golden light in Area 29.

Whether or not there's a golden light is affected by whether or not a lever has been pulled in a different room. Room 29 **needs** to let us know that this is the case (otherwise we're likely to forget).

Keys and locks are in quotes because they're not only literal, mundane locks and keys, but also any abstract lock and key in the [game design sense](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wW0O3YK2dpo). For example, from [The Necropolis of Nuromen](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/110292):

> **(9) Neuromen's Apartments**
> ...
> The girl's bony wrist bears a silver bracelet which has her name, "Anthea", engraved upon it. The girl's name is the password to the magician’s study (12).

When we read this, we skip forward to (12) and make sure that it tells us the password is "Anthea" and this can be found in (9). Nuromen partially succeeds at this:

> **(12) Nuromen's Study**
> ...
> When anyone approaches the copper-plated door to this hall, a corpse face moulded into its surface will animate and state, “NONE MAY PASS UNLESS THEY KNOW THE WORD.” The password is Anthea, the name of Nuromen's daughter. If this is offered, the face will moan, "You may pass." as the door swings open.

Better is to also mention where this information can be discovered:

> **(12) Nuromen's Study**
> ...
> When anyone approaches the copper-plated door to this hall, a corpse face moulded into its surface will animate and state, “NONE MAY PASS UNLESS THEY KNOW THE WORD.” The password is Anthea, the name of Nuromen's daughter (Found in (9)). If this is offered, the face will moan, "You may pass." as the door swings open.

Finally, **differentiate** mundane keys. If you tell the delvers that they found a key, they just write down "key". You might know that it's for the door to area 25, but they don't. Then they find 4 more keys. Eventually when they get to area 25 and ask if any of the keys fit, you'll have to be like "do ya'll have the uh, key from... area 9?"

This is totally circumvented by making each key unique. "Small brass key", "Big iron key", "twisted key" etc. Just make sure you update both room you find the key in and the room the key unlocks. "Unlocked by the key from area 9" becomes "Unlocked by the twisted key (9)".


#### Inline Monster Stats

Do not trust in-line monster stats. Adventures, for some forsaken reason, assume you're familiar with the bestiary and don't bother to include important stats (like movement speed) or special abilties. For instance, check out this description of a Troll from [Tower Silveraxe](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/358825)

> **troll**(AC4[15],HD6+3*(30hp), Att 2 x talon(1d6), 1 x bite(1d10), THAC0 13[+6], ML 10(8 fear of fire))

Compare this to the [stat block from OSE](https://oldschoolessentials.necroticgnome.com/srd/index.php/Troll) (which Silveraxe is built for):

> **Troll**
>
> Intelligent, wicked, 8’ tall humanoids with emaciated, rubbery bodies. Consume the flesh of other humanoids. Dwell underground, in barren wilderness, and in the ruined homes of former victims.
>
> AC 4[15] HD 6+3* (30hp), Att 2 × talon (1d6), 1 × bite (1d10), THAC0 13[+6], MV 120’(40’), SV F6, ML 10 (8 ***fear of fire**), AL Chaotic, XP 650
>
> - **Regeneration**: 3 rounds after being damaged, start regaining 3hp per round. Severed limbs reattach.
> - **Return from death**: If killed (0hp), will regenerate and fight again in 2d6 rounds.
> - **Fire and acid**: Cannot regenerate damage from these sources. The only way to permanently kill a troll.
> - **Fear of fire**: Morale 8 when attacked with fire or acid.

The Silveraxe statline leaves out the bit about acid, and their **entire regeneration ability**. My experience is that this happens *over and over*.

Throw out the inline stats and look up the monster from [Osric](https://osricwiki.presgas.name/doku.php?id=osric:chapter5). Osric monsters tend to be a little more powerful than OSE monsters and Sovereign delvers are more powerful than OSE characters of the same level.
