# Running The Game

This document is written for a fresh GM, but veteran GMs may still find useful ideas. Most of these ideas are not original, rather they have been consolidated from dozens of books and hundreds of [blogs](https://campaignwiki.org/osr/).

## Getting a Group Together

I *highly* recommend trying to play in-person. The easy way to do this is to ask friends to play. If that's not an option, or to fill in extra seats at the table, the [looking for group subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/lfg/) works. I can personally vouch for it. There are other services like [startplaying.games](https://startplaying.games/search).

Finally, it's worth advertising at your friendly local game store. They often let people reserve tables or have a dedicated night. If you google "friendly local game store near me", you'll hopefully get some nearby places. If you don't, experiment with... moving to a city. Once you find one, call them and ask about D&D, that's usually way faster than trying to navigate bespoke (and frequently out of date) websites.

## Actually Playing

Get people together, *noncommittally* to see if they like playing in your game. Make sure they're safe, and that you'd be comfortable having them in your house. I like to have lunch with people at a restaurant before inviting them to my home (sort of like how dating works), but meeting at a game store in the beginning works too.

Once you have a group together, **fully commit** to a schedule. There's a line from ACKs 2e that I like a lot:

> If you’re planning to start a successful campaign, you need to explain to your friends that you are not hosting a series of social events. You are starting an intramural sports team and asking them if they’d like to be on the team.

At social events, it's okay for people to bail or show up late. In team sports, it's *not okay*. They're *letting the team down*. This is a *commitment*. If that scares them off, that's fine! Find someone who *really* wants to play. Lots of people *pay* for a game master, no one pays for players. Plenty of people really do want to be there; find those people. Setting this expectation properly will save more grief than anything else.

Even so, stuff will come up. Birthday parties, holidays, travel, etc. Make it clear ahead of time that you'll play so long as half of the players can make it. Decide up front what to do with the characters of the players who aren't there. Some folks are unattached, and don't mind if someone else pilots their character. Some people *love* their character, or no one feels comfortable accepting that responsibility. In these cases, I handwave those characters away. Trying to narratively explain how these characters pop in and out isn't worth it. Just tell the players this. For example:

**GM**: You check the door - it's locked. What do you do?

**Alice**: Dang - Bob's (who is on vacation) character Bogdan is the one with all the [Sneak](/rules#sneak). Can his character pick the lock?

**GM**: No - though I think Bob should be around for next session. Bogdan *just isn't here* and I'm not going to try to figure out how to explain the dissapearance or his smooth reappearance next week, I've tried before and it's always too weird.

**Alice**: Hah - fine, so maybe we... bash the door in?

## Handling Interpersonal Problems

Just talk to them. Seriously. Don't post about it on social media and ask for advice. Don't do mean stuff to their characters as retribution. Tell them how your behavior is impacting you, and suggest other ways for them to behave instead. Listen to them. Not everyone is a good fit for every table. It's totally fine to let folks know that they aren't a good fit for the table. It doesn't need to be dramatic and shouldn't be (sort of like dating).

## Necessary Materials

- Pens. [Uniball Signo DX 0.38](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003FXWGWE). I personally use a [Pilot Prera](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0016YYKUA).
- Pencils. [Paper Mate Sharpwriter 0.7](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00OQQ05JA)
- Paper. [20lb Amazon White](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FV0F8H8)
- Dice. [Chessex Pound-O-Dice](https://www.amazon.com/Chessex-001LBCHX-Pound-O-Dice/dp/B008C0KXYS). I *highly* recommend folks use a different color for each size of dice as they're learning.
- Card Stock. [Printworks 67lb](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FX5LCXK). For item and spell handouts.
- Scissors. [Amazon Basics](https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Basics-Multipurpose-Titanium-Stainless/dp/B01BRGU8R0). For cutting out character sheets, items and spell handouts.
- A Battlemap. [Melee Mats 24x36](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MQHECUR). This one is dry-erase compatible, which is great.
- Dry Erase Markers. [Amazon Basics, 12 ct](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00T3ROM9G). If you have a wet erase battlemap, get wet erase markers instead.
- Meeples. [100pc Apostrophe Games](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07BZ36NYJ). Label each color 1 through 10 with a Sharpie and use them for monsters.
- Delver Icons. [Magnets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B016DSBNY4) + [Epoxy Stickers](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFRWIRQ) + [Hole Punch](https://www.amazon.com/Bira-Circle-Craft-Crafting-Scrapbooking/dp/B07B43X316). From [JP Coovert's Youtube](https://youtu.be/LBZPi4oKlCQ?si=mTP5tiOjJyb1ITeu).
- Printer. [Brother HL-L2350DW](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B09961WKKS). Good for printing modules, character sheets, maps, handouts, etc.
- Awl. [General Tools Awl](https://www.amazon.com/General-Tools-818-Hardwood-Scratch/dp/B00004T7R3). Sewn digest modules lay much more nicely than stapled ones.
- Needle and Thread [Slimthread Polyester](https://www.amazon.com/Simthread-Purpose-Thread-Polyester-Yards/dp/B0B9FQ2QN4). To bind modules with.
- 3 Ring Binder. [Samsill 0.5"](https://www.amazon.com/Samsill-Economy-Ring-Binder-5-Round/dp/B07FKXHP1H). Some modules are natively printed on big paper (like Castle Xyntillan) and printing them out digest style makes the font painfully small. For these, we use a hole punch and a 3 ring binder. Additionally, GM notes go in a separate 3-ring binder.
- 3 Hole Punch. [Amazon Basics](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Hole-Punch-Sheet-Capacity/dp/B0879YNTTP)

The specific product recommendations are all optional. At a higher level, you need some way to:

- Record character information (pencil and paper)
- Generate random numbers (dice)
- Take GM notes (pen, paper, 3-ring binder)
- Read modules (printer and paper)
- Prepare modules (pen, printed module)
- Represent a battle (battle map, markers, meeples, delver icons)

As long as you have these things handled, you're good.
