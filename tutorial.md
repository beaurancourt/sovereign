# Tutorial

Rather than the rest of this document which is designed to be an efficient and clear reference, this section is designed to *teach*.

There will be both examples as well as *exercises*. It's easy enough to *think* you understand the material, but then go blank when asked questions that test edge cases or understanding. Feel free to *look up* the answers to exercises, but you're cheating yourself if you just click to see the answer before attempting.

## Delver Creation

Have a read through the [delver creation](/delver-creation) document, top to bottom. When you're finished, grab a blank page of paper and *actually* create a character, writing your own labels for the data that you need to record.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise</strong>: Say that a Warrior has a Strength of 17. What is their STR?</summary>
  <p>+1. This is notable becuase in BX it would be +2 and in D&D5e it would be +3. Sovereign uses a more narrow mod distribution because it also uses skills.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise</strong>: Can a character guarantee an 18 in at least one attribute, regardless of how poor they roll?</summary>
  <p>Yes. They can choose 1 attribute to start at 14 in step #2, and then can improve that stat four times to 18, though their skills would be very poor.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise</strong>: Say a Delver wants to roll a Dex/Sneak check with a +1 bonus. They have 11 Dexterity and no Sneak skill. How might they do this?</summary>
  <p>They either need +1 DEX and Sneak-0, or +0 DEX and Sneak-1.</p>
  <p>Getting to +1 DEX would take 3 of their 4 improvements, and they could spend the last one on Sneak.</p>
  <p>Alternatively, getting to Sneak-1 just takes 2 improvements.</p>
  <p>Finally, they could save themselves an improvement by choosing a Feat (or multiple feats) that grant Sneak as a bonus skill, like <a href="/feats#assassin-">Assassin</a> or <a href="/feats#imposter">Imposter</a>.</p>
  <p>Note the dynamics here. There are more skills than attributes, so skills apply more narrowly and attributes apply more broadly. Attributes, in turn, tend to be more expensive to meaningfully upgrade.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise</strong>: What are the benefits to being a partial Warrior?</summary>
  <p>There are three: they gain an extra Combat feat at level 1, they get the Warrior's superior HP progression (1d6+2 each level), and they get the Warrior's superior attack bonus progression (+1 each level)</p>
  <p>The downside is that they <strong>do not</strong> get the Warrior's <a href="class-ability-veterans-luck">Veteran’s Luck</a> or <a href="class-ability-killing-blow">Killing Blow</a> abilities</p> As a result, they'll be less accurate (because they can't turn misses into hits), less hardy (because they can't turn hits on them into misses), and less damaging (because they don't add their level to their shock or damage).
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise</strong>: Why do we wait until after choosing a class and feats to determine attribute modifiers?</summary>
  <p>Because Mages gain a bonus skill related to their arcane tradition, like how High Mages gain Magic. Similarly, some feats like <a href="/feats#poisoner">Poisoner</a> grant a bonus skill.</p>
  <p>If the Delver already has that skill at rank 1, they instead get a free improvement which they may spend on improving an attribute. This, in turn, might change its modifier.</p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise</strong>: An Expert rolls a 14 for their starting gold. They are starting play in a small hamlet, with a population of 300. How many pints of <a href="/equipment#holy-water">Holy Water</a> can they start with?</summary>
  <p> 5. They would have 14•10 = 140g, and 5 vials costs 125g. We do not need consider <a href="/equipment#equipment-availability">Equipment Availabilty</a> at character creation, though afterwards the whole party only has a 10% chance of being able to purchase one vial a month from the hamlet.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise</strong>: Can you be an Elf or Dwarf?</summary>
  <p>Probably! This is up to to the GM and their setting. Regardless, Elves and Dwarves have no mechanical benefit over any other ancestry for Delvers, so you're free to pick purely on flavor. If you want your Delver to feel more traditionally elvish or dwarvish, give them fitting Feats.</p>

<details>
  <summary><strong>Exercise</strong>: Can I have darkvision or infravision?</summary>
  <p>Yes, though you'll have to take the right <a href="/arcane-traditions">Arcane Tradition</a>.</p>
