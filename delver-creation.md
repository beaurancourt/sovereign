# Delver Creation

Adventuring is a profession, and all Delvers have undergone extensive training to become 1st level. They can clean and sharpen weapons, set up camp, cook meals, ride mounts, perform first aid, know the value of coins, trade goods, treasure, and identify common magical effects and monsters.

1. **Choose a character concept**. Discuss what your role will be in the team. A well-rounded party needs a way to deal with melee enemies, a way to deal with ranged or flying enemies, a way to deal with mundane security measures (guards, locked doors, traps), a way to deal with magical security measures, and a way to keep everyone healthy when things go south. A team of a melee-focused [Warrior](/classes#warrior), Sneak-focused [Expert](/classes#expert), utility-focued [High Mage](/arcane-traditions#high-mage), and [Partial Warrior](/classes#partial-warrior)/[Healer](/arcane-traditions#healer) is well-rounded, but part of the fun is trying out other compositions.

2. **Generate Attributes**. For each of the five [Attributes](/rules#attributes), assign them a score of `3d6` in order. With your role on the team in mind, pick an Attribute to raise to 14. Record all of your attributes.

3. **Starting Improvements**. Make a total of 4 <span id="improvement">Improvements<span> to your [Skills](/rules#skills) or [Attributes](/rules#attributes). To improve an Attribute, raise it by 1 to a max of 18. To improve a Skill, raise its level by 1 to a max of 1. All skills start at level -1. A single Attribute or Skill can be improved multiple times.

4. **Choose a Class**. Pick either a full [Class](/classes) or combine two Partial Classes. [Warriors](/classes#warrior) are great at [combat](/combat), [Experts](/classes#expert) are great a [skill checks](/rules#skills), and [Mages](/classes#mage) have specialized [supernatural powers](/arcane-traditions) or [spells](/spells).

5. **Choose Feats**. Each class gets a different starting amount of [Feats](/feats) at first level, detailed in the "Feats" column. Some Feats, like [Alert](/feats#Alert-c) grant a [Bonus Skill](/rules#bonus-skill). Raise that skill by one level to a maximum of level 1. If that skill is *already* level 1, make a free [improvement](#improvement).

6. **Record Attribute Modifiers**. Each [Attribute](/rules#attributes) has a [Modifier](/rules#attribute-modifiers), usually ranging from -2 to +2 based on its score. This modifier is added to skill checks, attack rolls, damage rolls, Shock damage, and the relevant saving throw targets.

7. **Generate Maximum Hit Points**. Each class gets different amount of [Hit Points](/rules#hit-points) (HP) at first level according to their [HP Progression](/rules#hp-progression). Roll based on your class, add your CON, and +2 if you chose the [Die Hard](/feats#die-hard-c) Feat.

8. **Record Attack Bonus**. Your character has a certain degree of basic combat competence based on their class. This bonus increases as you advance in character levels and is added to your attack roll. A new character’s attack bonus is usually +0, though full Warriors start with a +1 attack bonus.

9. **Record Saving Throws**. Record your [Physical](/rules#physical) (exhaustion, poison, etc), [Evasion](/rules#evasion) (explosions, traps, etc), and [Mental](/rules#mental) (mind control, tests of will, etc) [Saving Throws](/rules#saving-throws). Your [Physical](/rules#physical) score is 15 minus the highest of your STR and CON. Your [Evasion](/rules#evasion) score is 15 minus the highest of your INT and DEX. Your [Mental](/rules#mental) score is 15 minus the highest of your INT and WIS.

10. **Choose Starting Gear**. Gain `3d6 x 10` gold to spend on [gear](/equipment) (ignoring [Equipment Availability](/equipment#equipment-availability)), noting thier [Encumbrance](/rules#encumbrance) and whether they are [Readied](/rules#readied) or [Stowed](/rules#stowed). You may carry Readied equipment equal to half your Strength rounded down. You may carry Stowed equipment equal to your Strength. Other party members may be willing to Stow gear for you.

11. **Record Weapon Statistics**. Record the total attack bonus for your weaponry. This is equal to your attack bonus plus your relevant Stab, Shoot, or [Brawl](/rules#brawl) skill, and the relevant [attribute modifier](/rules#attribute-modifiers) for the weapon given on the weapon table. If two attributes are listed for a weapon, use whichever is better for you. For each weapon’s damage and [Shock](/combat#shock), note down the information from the table. You add your attribute modifier to both damage rolls and Shock. [Brawl](/rules#brawl) weapons or unarmed attacks also add your [Brawl](/rules#brawl) skill.

12. **Record Armor Class**. Record the [Armor Class](/equipment#armor-class) (AC) of the armor you normally wear. AC is modified by DEX.

13. **Mages Choose Starting Spells**. [High Mages](/arcane-traditions#high-mage), [Elementalists](/arcane-traditions#elementalist), and [Necromancers](/arcane-traditions#necromancer) begin play knowing [Spells](/spells) based on their [Arcane Tradition](/arcane-traditions). These spells are chosen from any spell list available to them. Full Mages choose 4 starting spells, and Partial Mages choose 2. A new full High Mage, for example, would pick four first-level spells from the [High Magic spell list](/spells#high-magic-spells), while a new partial Elementalist could pick two spells total from either the High Magic or [Elementalist spell list](/spells#elementalist-spells).

14. **Mages Record Effort**. All Mages start with a pool of [Effort](/classes#effort) specific to their class. Refer to your chosen class's section for how to calculate it.

14. **Mages Choose Starting Arts**. All Mages select Arts based on their class. Refer to your chosen class for specific details.

15. **Create Descriptive Details**. Imagine an appearance, brief history, personality, mannerisms, and motivations for your character. Bear in mind that your character *will be* going on adventures and *will be* part of a team. Endeavor to create a character that *wants* to go on adventures, and *wants* to be part of a team.
